covid19,Why Some Young People Fear Social Isolation More Than COVID-19,NPR,https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&sa=t&url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/07/04/885546281/why-some-young-people-fear-social-isolation-more-than-covid-19&ct=ga&cd=CAAYADIdZmQyNzJjNDk4NjUwYWNmYzpjb20uc2c6ZW46U0c&usg=AFQjCNEQDUJ5af7sX7Q9TYfN07VMWw63YA,"YUKI NOGUCHIRecent protests in Philadelphia and across the country have drawn young people. But for most of the pandemic, youth have been quarantined and away from their social circles, which could make depression and other mental illness worse.Audrey just turned 18 and relishes crossing into adulthood: She voted for the first time this year, graduated high school and is college-bound next month. The honors student typically wakes up ""a bundle of nerves,"" she says, which had fueled her work volunteering, playing varsity sports and leading student government.But for years, she also struggled with anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder — all of which drove her to work harder.""I was spending so much time on my homework, I felt like I was losing my friends — so my thoughts would race over and over again about my friends,"" says Audrey. ""And then I would have the difficult thoughts about suicide and some scarier stuff."" (NPR agreed to use only her first name to protect her medical privacy.)Audrey's psychological struggles landed her in mental health treatment last fall. There, she says, the coping skills she learned gave her perspective on quarantine: ""I know all about how seeing friends and seeing people outside — and social interaction — is vital for survival.""There is a simmering tension between young people's desire to gather socially, and the growing threat from the coronavirus in the United States. The virus is now infecting more people in their teens and 20s than it had earlier in the pandemic, and that's contributing to outbreaks, especially in states in the South and West. As a result, public health officials are imploring young adults to limit social contact and take precautions to help protect their more vulnerable elders. But many young people see continued social isolation as a much greater risk than COVID-19 to their own mental health.It's not that Audrey isn't worried about the pandemic; in fact, confirmed cases of the coronavirus are spiking in her hometown of Charlotte, N.C. So Audrey wears masks, washes her hands and stays 6 feet from friends. But for her generation, she says, infection isn't the primary threat.""A lot of people are calling attention to coronavirus because it's right in front of us,"" she says. ""But at the same time, teens' depression rate — it's a silent threat.""The health risks of infection differ by generation. For many young adults, life lived at a social distance, with a lack of peer support, comes at a high cost to mental health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says nearly half of people between 18 and 29 report feeling symptoms of anxiety or depression. That's significantly higher that the rate for both their parents and their grandparents. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for people under 35.Yet somehow, says Audrey, that's not talked about as much.""We haven't seen the government or adults as passionate about the things we really care about, like mental health and climate issues,"" she says.It might be tempting to think that FaceTime and Zoom provide substitutes for in-person social outlets, especially for a generation of digital natives who grew up with smartphones. But, therapists say, talking by small screen offers no replacement for a calming hug and can miss the subtleties of a compassionate expression.Audrey's complaint is a common refrain among the adolescent and young adult patients whom psychologist Lisa Jacobs counsels. It is not that they aren't concerned about the risks of COVID-19, she says; it's just that their risk calculations differ.""They are appropriately realizing that isolation is a risk for them as well — it's a risk factor for depression, and depression is a risk factor for suicide,"" Jacobs says. ""And 8% of American teens attempt suicide each year.""Jacobs says many of her young patients complain older generations failed to address the young people's fears — of school shootings and climate change, for example.""After not being protected, after not being taken seriously, they were asked to take extreme measures to protect other groups and to put themselves at risk by doing so,"" Jacobs says.There is a biological basis for young people's need for socialization. Scientists say bonding isn't a luxury; it's critical for development.Young brains need social connection to feel secure about their identity and place in the world, says Gregory Lewis, who studies the neurobiology of social interaction at Indiana University.If You Need Help: ResourcesIf you or someone you know is in crisis, help is available. Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255, or go here to chat online.For more help:""We expect as a human being to have other people there to share the stressful times and to be our backup, and when they're not there physically, that in of itself tells our nervous system 'you're in a dangerous environment because you don't have these people here,' "" he says.That is less of an issue among older adults, Lewis says, who have had more time to develop their social networks — both at work and around their community — and more time to find partners who can help ground them emotionally. By contrast, he says, ""younger people are missing a larger percentage of what previously was there to buffer them.""So the societal challenge, he says, is to find ways to help community members of all ages balance the risks of infection against the need to foster those essential social bonds.NPR thanks our sponsorsBecome an NPR sponsor"
covid19,Covid-19 is here to stay. People will have to adapt,The Economist,https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&sa=t&url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/07/04/covid-19-is-here-to-stay-people-will-have-to-adapt&ct=ga&cd=CAAYATIdZmQyNzJjNDk4NjUwYWNmYzpjb20uc2c6ZW46U0c&usg=AFQjCNEBhzYKM2_eTI2WSkmlWKn2XEZukw,"The world is not experiencing a second wave: it never got over the firstEditor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter. For more stories and our pandemic tracker, see our hubI
t is astonishing how rapidly the pandemic has spread, despite all the efforts to stop it. On February 1st, the day covid-19 first appeared on our front cover, the World Health Organisation counted 2,115 new cases. On June 28th its daily tally reached 190,000. That day as many new cases were notched up every 90 minutes as had been recorded in total by February 1st.The world is not experiencing a second wave: it never got over the first. Some 10m people are known to have been infected. Pretty much everywhere has registered cases (Turkmenistan and North Korea have not, though, like Antarctica). For every country such as China, Taiwan and Vietnam, which seems to be able to contain the virus, there are more, in Latin America and South Asia, where it is raging. Others, including the United States, are at risk of losing control or, in much of Africa, in the early phase of their epidemic. Europe is somewhere in between.The worst is to come. Based on research in 84 countries, a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reckons that, for each recorded case, 12 go unrecorded and that for every two covid-19 deaths counted, a third is misattributed to other causes. Without a medical breakthrough, it says, the total number of cases will climb to 200m-600m by spring 2021. At that point, between 1.4m and 3.7m people will have died. Even then, well over 90% of the world’s population will still be vulnerable to infection—more if immunity turns out to be transient.The actual outcome depends on how societies manage the disease. Here the news is better. Epidemiologists understand how to stop covid-19. You catch it indoors, in crowds, when people raise their voices. The poor are vulnerable, as are the elderly and those with other conditions. You can contain the virus with three tactics: changes in behaviour; testing, tracing and isolation; and, if they fail, lockdowns. The worse a country is at testing—and many governments have failed to build enough capacity—the more it has to fall back on the other two. Good public health need not be expensive. Dharavi, a slum of 850,000 people in Mumbai, tamed an outbreak (see article).Treatments have improved, thanks to research and dealing with patients. Although mass vaccination is still months away at best (see article), the first therapies are available. More is known about how to manage the disease—don’t rush to put people on respirators, do give them oxygen early. Better treatment helps explain why the share of hospital patients who went on to be admitted to intensive care fell in Britain from 12% at the end of March to 4% in mid to late May.And economies have adapted. They are still suffering, of course. J.P. Morgan, a bank, predicts that the peak-to-trough decline in the first half of the year in the 39 economies it follows will be around 10% of gdp. But workers stuck in Zoom hell have discovered that they can get a surprising amount done from home. In China Starbucks designed “contactless” ordering, cutting the time customers spend in its coffee shops. Supply chains that struggled now run smoothly. Factories have found ways to stagger shifts, shield staff behind plastic and change work patterns so that personal contact is minimised.Now that nationwide lockdowns are done, governments can make sensible trade-offs—banning large indoor gatherings, say and allowing the reopening of schools and shops. Sometimes, as in some American states, they will loosen too much and have to reverse course. Others will learn from their mistakes.The problem is that, without a cure or a vaccine, containment depends on people learning to change their behaviour. After the initial covid-19 panic, many are becoming disenchanted and resistant. Masks help stop the disease, but in Europe and America some refuse to wear one because they see them as emasculating or, worse, Democratic. Thorough handwashing kills the virus, but who has not relapsed into bad old habits? Parties are dangerous but young people cooped up for months have developed a devil-may-care attitude. Most important, as the months drag on, people just need to earn some money. In the autumn, as life moves indoors, infections could soar.Changing social norms is hard. Just look at aids, known for decades to be prevented by safe sex and clean needles. Yet in 2018, 1.7m people were newly infected with hiv, the virus that causes it. Covid-19 is easier to talk about than aids, but harder to avoid. Wearing a mask is chiefly about protecting others; the young, fit and asymptomatic are being asked to follow tedious rules to shield the old and infirm.Changing behaviour requires clear communication from trusted figures, national and local. But many people do not believe their politicians. In countries such as America, Iran, Britain, Russia and Brazil, which have the highest caseloads, presidents and prime ministers minimised the threat, vacillated, issued bad advice or seemed more interested in their own political fortunes than in their country—sometimes all at once.Covid-19 is here for a while at least. The vulnerable will be afraid to go out and innovation will slow, creating a 90% economy that consistently fails to reach its potential. Many people will fall ill and some of them will die. You may have lost interest in the pandemic. It has not lost interest in you. ■Editor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter.

covid19,If you are infected: demystifying Covid-19 care,The Indian Express,https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&sa=t&url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/if-you-are-infected-demystifying-covid-19-care-6485803/&ct=ga&cd=CAAYAjIdZmQyNzJjNDk4NjUwYWNmYzpjb20uc2c6ZW46U0c&usg=AFQjCNG627f0kC21K7KgJFDRbjOrkLmTmw,"Written by Dr Satchit Balsari, Dr Zarir UdwadiaAfter three months of missteps, there seems to be consensus — or rather a late realisation — that not all patients with Covid-19 need to be taken to hospitals. We have known with fair certainty since early March that Covid-19 does not spread like Ebola, and that in the absence of effective medical treatment, non-pharmaceutical interventions like hand-washing, masking and physical distancing would be the best defence. And yet, for nearly one hundred days, confirmed cases of Covid-19 in India’s cities were being admitted to hospitals, irrespective of the severity of disease.This blunder — with no clinical justification — resulted in first paralysing, then overwhelming, and finally crushing entire health systems. The hospitals were rendered incapable of caring for tens of thousands of other patients with non-Covid-related diseases, and jeopardised the wellbeing of their overworked staff. What can other cities, towns and villages in India learn from this, as the pandemic spreads to the hinterland?Explained | The G4 flu virus with ‘pandemic potential’, found by Chinese researchers?There are a finite number of permutations that can occur, when someone is exposed to Covid-19. Let’s walk through these possibilities, and the possible care pathways each situation warrants.Asymptomatics: If exposed, one gets Covid-19 or one doesn’t. Of all who get it, most will be asymptomatic: they will show no symptoms, but will continue to spread it. It is likely that they may be less contagious than someone who is actively coughing, but there is no evidence to suggest that the asymptomatic patients do not spread the virus. They, however, need no treatment.Presymptomatics and mild cases: Of the few that are symptomatic, all will first be pre-symptomatic. This is the roughly two-day interval in which they will be contagious, will spread the virus, but will not have developed symptoms. Eventually they will develop one or a combination of the Covid-19 symptoms we recognise: loss of smell or taste, cough, fever, and so on.Most of these symptomatic cases will only have mild symptoms and will also need no treatment, except what physicians appropriately call “symptomatic management”, with medications to simply manage the fever and cough and bodyaches. Home remedies may help with some of this, but there is no evidence that they alter the course of the disease.Symptomatics, moderate: Of the remainder, some will develop moderate symptoms, and some will develop severe disease. Only these two categories need sophisticated medical intervention.Explained | What is Covaxin, India’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate?Those with moderate symptoms will benefit from oxygen therapy, and “pronation,” which in plain English, means lying on your belly, instead of your back. Doing so opens up the air chambers in the back of your lungs that are normally collapsed, thereby providing more oxygen to your blood. Early evidence shows that this helps avert the need for more aggressive intervention in some cases.But the principal intervention for those with moderate severity is oxygen — which can be delivered through a mask and tube connected to a portable oxygen tank (which like a gas cylinder, is heavy, and must be replaced); or as piped oxygen, as is available in some hospitals, and which comes from larger tanks; or simply via a small, portable machine called an oxygen concentrator which makes oxygen from air. Many people with lung diseases have them at home. There is no clinical justification to take up ICU beds for these patients. They do not need ventilators, or intensive care specialists — especially when no city in India has enough of either, and most smaller towns and villages have neither.Severe cases: Unlike run-of-the-mill pneumonias, we have observed that the shortness of breath in patients with Covid-19 can progress abruptly, and these patients need ventilators. These breathing machines are highly complex systems that need skilled technicians to run them, and require that patients have a flexible plastic tube advanced into their trachea (windpipe), typically by an anaesthesiologist or emergency physicians or intensivists. The patients then have to be kept sedated (asleep) with a precisely dosed intravenous medication — an overdose of which can easily kill the patient. And finally, plasma donated from Covid-19 survivors helps some of the sickest. These are the critical elements of an “ICU bed” — there is nothing special about the bed itself.📣 Express Explained is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@ieexplained) and stay updated with the latestCommunity-based care: The best way to relax the load on hospitals is to keep all those who do not need hospital-based care, away from hospitals — for as long as is safely possible. Keeping people home safely means monitoring symptomatic patients by measuring their respiratory rate (counting how many breaths they take per minute — the average person takes about 12) and their oxygen saturation, using a small device that clips on to your fingertips, called pulse-oximeter. Neighbourhood champions and community health workers can be easily taught to do this via online teaching aids.If the oxygen saturation begins to go down, or the respiratory rate begins to go up, the patients need intervention — first, oxygen therapy. Most will not have access to hospitals, and can be safely given oxygen at home when possible, or in neighbourhood Covid-care centres. A minority will have to go to hospital.There will, of course, be many exceptions to this neat linear progression, but the vast majority will follow this trajectory, as data from around the world are showing. (We still don’t have reliable clinical data from India.)This strategy is not new. By early April, patients in New York, where the epidemic was then at its peak, were being sent home with pulse-oximeters and even oxygen concentrators. Various states in India were at the time embracing unproven, unvalidated interventions.Don’t miss from Explained | Bad June, two lakh cases in last 12 daysInstead of distributing spice mixtures, arsenicum album and hydroxychloroquine, it will now be wiser to distribute pulse-oximeters to communities at risk. So far, early data suggest that a steroid and the antiviral remdesivir may show some benefit in more severe hospitalised cases. Favipiravir has been approved for use in moderate cases in India, but the data have not been released. Note however, that a similar wonder-drug for influenza mostly brings down symptoms by a day. These medications are not cures.Covid-19 will ravage neighbourhoods across India. The best strategy will be to mount a hyper-local response that is backed by science. Dharavi and Kerala — very different from each other — have shown how a highly context-driven strategy works. Most of those who will get Covid-19 will be fine. Among those who have some symptoms, monitor as many as possible with pulse-oximeters (or simply by counting the respiratory rate, when devices run out). And if short of breath, administer oxygenation and pronation.A minority will get very sick, and will require critical care. The harsh reality is that most from the last group will not get the care they need. We cannot fix decades of neglect while in the throes of a pandemic.(Dr Satchit Balsari is assistant professor in Emergency Medicine and in Global Health at Harvard University’s medical and public health schools.

Four of the nine community cases were Singaporeans, three were work pass holders, and two were work permit holders.COMMUNITY CASESOf the nine community cases, one is linked to a previous case, while eight are currently unlinked.Of the eight unlinked cases, one is an 82-year-old Singaporean woman, whose onset of symptoms began on Jul 1. She was confirmed to have COVID-19 on Saturday.The only linked case is a 38-year-old Bangladeshi national, who is a contact of previous case. He had already been quarantined earlier. He was asymptomatic and was tested during quarantine to verify his status, MOH said.Of the eight unlinked cases, three were ""proactively swabbed"" as they work in essential services, even though two were asymptomatic. Another unlinked case was detected as part of MOH's ""proactive"" screening of individuals deployed to frontline COVID-19 operations.Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the remaining four cases. Of those four cases, three were tested under the ministry's enhanced community testing after being diagnosed with acute respiratory infection.The number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average of six per day in the week before, to an average of nine per day in the past week.The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased, from an average of three cases per day in the week before, to an average of five per day in the past week.""We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme,"" MOH said.IMPORTED CASEThe health ministry reported a new imported case involving a permanent resident, who is a family member of a previous case.The 11-year-old had returned from India on Jun 21, and was placed on a stay-home notice upon his arrival in Singapore.He was taken to an isolation facility to start his 14-day notice. The boy was asymptomatic, and was tested while serving the stay-home notice.A total of 175 cases reported on Saturday were work permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories, the ministry added. No new clusters were identified.348 MORE PATIENTS DISCHARGEDMOH reported that 348 more COVID-19 patients have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 40,117 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.There are currently 204 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and two are in a critical condition in the intensive care unit. A total of 4,317 cases are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are people who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. Twenty-six people have died from complications due to COVID-19 infection.TESTING AT TAMPINES BLOCKMOH said on Thursday that it placed 58 households at Block 111 Tampines Street 11 under active phone surveillance and that these residents and their visitors would be tested for COVID-19.""This is a precautionary measure after MOH had detected nine confirmed cases from two households residing at the block.""In total, 116 residents and visitors have been tested, and all the results have come back
negative for COVID-19. MOH will continue to closely monitor the situation,"" the ministry said. On Friday, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) announced hotels in Singapore may apply to reopen for staycation bookings. However, hotels will have to comply with various safe management measures to do so.Cinemas are also allowed to reopen from Jul 13, with up to 50 patrons in each cinema hall.Singapore is currently in Phase 2 of its reopening, which began on Jun 19.Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright© Mediacorp 2020.

COVID19 is a coronavirus therefore antiretroviral medications do NOT have a protective effect on COVID19.HIV patients do not have an increased risk for COVID19 if they are currently undetectable and have an acceptable/normal amount of CD4 cells.Further to this; though some anti-HIV medications are being studied to treat or prevent COVID-19, there is no evidence yet that they work.To date lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) and tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada), were thought may be effective but updates from trials have not shown effectiveness.To expand upon, someone who is undetectable is someone under treatment. They take their meds on time and regularly, and go get tested two-to-four times a year. Someone who is undetectable is also uninfectious, which is why civilized nations subsidize or cover HIV treatment.Someone who is not being treated, whose virus is resistant to current treatment, or who is unable to maintain the drug regimen, will be susceptible to their CD4 count falling, which means their immune system becomes more vulnerable. Such a person will be more vulnerable to COVID and other infections and will be infectious; the higher your virus level, the more infectious you are.MembersOnline"
