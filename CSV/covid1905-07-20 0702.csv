Find out where the virus has spread, and where it has been most deadlyPablo GutiérrezSat 4 Jul 2020 16.48 BST
Last modified on Sat 4 Jul 2020Since first being recorded late last year in China, the Covid-19 coronavirus has spread around the world, and been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. However, differences in testing mean that the number of cases may be understated for some countries.The number of deaths is a more dependable indicator. The disease has hit certain countries, including Brazil, the UK and the US, with particular cruelty.Meanwhile in Asia, where the disease began, the spread continues, although in China it seems for now to have passed its peak.In Europe most countries have closed schools, and many are in lockdown.Finally, a reminder that most people who contract the disease recover; many may never notice they had it at all.Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication. Any significant corrections made to this or previous versions of the article will continue to be footnoted in line with Guardian editorial policy.... we have a small favour to ask.

covid19,Why Some Young People Fear Social Isolation More Than COVID-19,NPR,https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&sa=t&url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/07/04/885546281/why-some-young-people-fear-social-isolation-more-than-covid-19&ct=ga&cd=CAAYATIdZmQyNzJjNDk4NjUwYWNmYzpjb20uc2c6ZW46U0c&usg=AFQjCNEQDUJ5af7sX7Q9TYfN07VMWw63YA,"YUKI NOGUCHIRecent protests in Philadelphia and across the country have drawn young people. But for most of the pandemic, youth have been quarantined and away from their social circles, which could make depression and other mental illness worse.Audrey just turned 18 and relishes crossing into adulthood: She voted for the first time this year, graduated high school and is college-bound next month. The honors student typically wakes up ""a bundle of nerves,"" she says, which had fueled her work volunteering, playing varsity sports and leading student government.But for years, she also struggled with anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder — all of which drove her to work harder.""I was spending so much time on my homework, I felt like I was losing my friends — so my thoughts would race over and over again about my friends,"" says Audrey. ""And then I would have the difficult thoughts about suicide and some scarier stuff."" (NPR agreed to use only her first name to protect her medical privacy.)Audrey's psychological struggles landed her in mental health treatment last fall. There, she says, the coping skills she learned gave her perspective on quarantine: ""I know all about how seeing friends and seeing people outside — and social interaction — is vital for survival.""There is a simmering tension between young people's desire to gather socially, and the growing threat from the coronavirus in the United States. The virus is now infecting more people in their teens and 20s than it had earlier in the pandemic, and that's contributing to outbreaks, especially in states in the South and West. As a result, public health officials are imploring young adults to limit social contact and take precautions to help protect their more vulnerable elders. But many young people see continued social isolation as a much greater risk than COVID-19 to their own mental health.It's not that Audrey isn't worried about the pandemic; in fact, confirmed cases of the coronavirus are spiking in her hometown of Charlotte, N.C. So Audrey wears masks, washes her hands and stays 6 feet from friends. But for her generation, she says, infection isn't the primary threat.""A lot of people are calling attention to coronavirus because it's right in front of us,"" she says. ""But at the same time, teens' depression rate — it's a silent threat.""The health risks of infection differ by generation. For many young adults, life lived at a social distance, with a lack of peer support, comes at a high cost to mental health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says nearly half of people between 18 and 29 report feeling symptoms of anxiety or depression. That's significantly higher that the rate for both their parents and their grandparents. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for people under 35.Yet somehow, says Audrey, that's not talked about as much.""We haven't seen the government or adults as passionate about the things we really care about, like mental health and climate issues,"" she says.It might be tempting to think that FaceTime and Zoom provide substitutes for in-person social outlets, especially for a generation of digital natives who grew up with smartphones. But, therapists say, talking by small screen offers no replacement for a calming hug and can miss the subtleties of a compassionate expression.Audrey's complaint is a common refrain among the adolescent and young adult patients whom psychologist Lisa Jacobs counsels. It is not that they aren't concerned about the risks of COVID-19, she says; it's just that their risk calculations differ.""They are appropriately realizing that isolation is a risk for them as well — it's a risk factor for depression, and depression is a risk factor for suicide,"" Jacobs says. ""And 8% of American teens attempt suicide each year.""Jacobs says many of her young patients complain older generations failed to address the young people's fears — of school shootings and climate change, for example.""After not being protected, after not being taken seriously, they were asked to take extreme measures to protect other groups and to put themselves at risk by doing so,"" Jacobs says.There is a biological basis for young people's need for socialization. Scientists say bonding isn't a luxury; it's critical for development.Young brains need social connection to feel secure about their identity and place in the world, says Gregory Lewis, who studies the neurobiology of social interaction at Indiana University.If You Need Help: ResourcesIf you or someone you know is in crisis, help is available. Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255, or go here to chat online.For more help:""We expect as a human being to have other people there to share the stressful times and to be our backup, and when they're not there physically, that in of itself tells our nervous system 'you're in a dangerous environment because you don't have these people here,' "" he says.That is less of an issue among older adults, Lewis says, who have had more time to develop their social networks — both at work and around their community — and more time to find partners who can help ground them emotionally. By contrast, he says, ""younger people are missing a larger percentage of what previously was there to buffer them.""So the societal challenge, he says, is to find ways to help community members of all ages balance the risks of infection against the need to foster those essential social bonds.NPR thanks our sponsorsBecome an NPR sponsor"
covid19,Covid-19 is here to stay. People will have to adapt,The Economist,https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&sa=t&url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/07/04/covid-19-is-here-to-stay-people-will-have-to-adapt&ct=ga&cd=CAAYAjIdZmQyNzJjNDk4NjUwYWNmYzpjb20uc2c6ZW46U0c&usg=AFQjCNEBhzYKM2_eTI2WSkmlWKn2XEZukw,"The world is not experiencing a second wave: it never got over the firstEditor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter. For more stories and our pandemic tracker, see our hubI
t is astonishing how rapidly the pandemic has spread, despite all the efforts to stop it. On February 1st, the day covid-19 first appeared on our front cover, the World Health Organisation counted 2,115 new cases. On June 28th its daily tally reached 190,000. That day as many new cases were notched up every 90 minutes as had been recorded in total by February 1st.The world is not experiencing a second wave: it never got over the first. Some 10m people are known to have been infected. Pretty much everywhere has registered cases (Turkmenistan and North Korea have not, though, like Antarctica). For every country such as China, Taiwan and Vietnam, which seems to be able to contain the virus, there are more, in Latin America and South Asia, where it is raging. Others, including the United States, are at risk of losing control or, in much of Africa, in the early phase of their epidemic. Europe is somewhere in between.The worst is to come. Based on research in 84 countries, a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reckons that, for each recorded case, 12 go unrecorded and that for every two covid-19 deaths counted, a third is misattributed to other causes. Without a medical breakthrough, it says, the total number of cases will climb to 200m-600m by spring 2021. At that point, between 1.4m and 3.7m people will have died. Even then, well over 90% of the world’s population will still be vulnerable to infection—more if immunity turns out to be transient.The actual outcome depends on how societies manage the disease. Here the news is better. Epidemiologists understand how to stop covid-19. You catch it indoors, in crowds, when people raise their voices. The poor are vulnerable, as are the elderly and those with other conditions. You can contain the virus with three tactics: changes in behaviour; testing, tracing and isolation; and, if they fail, lockdowns. The worse a country is at testing—and many governments have failed to build enough capacity—the more it has to fall back on the other two. Good public health need not be expensive. Dharavi, a slum of 850,000 people in Mumbai, tamed an outbreak (see article).Treatments have improved, thanks to research and dealing with patients. Although mass vaccination is still months away at best (see article), the first therapies are available. More is known about how to manage the disease—don’t rush to put people on respirators, do give them oxygen early. Better treatment helps explain why the share of hospital patients who went on to be admitted to intensive care fell in Britain from 12% at the end of March to 4% in mid to late May.And economies have adapted. They are still suffering, of course. J.P. Morgan, a bank, predicts that the peak-to-trough decline in the first half of the year in the 39 economies it follows will be around 10% of gdp. But workers stuck in Zoom hell have discovered that they can get a surprising amount done from home. In China Starbucks designed “contactless” ordering, cutting the time customers spend in its coffee shops. Supply chains that struggled now run smoothly. Factories have found ways to stagger shifts, shield staff behind plastic and change work patterns so that personal contact is minimised.Now that nationwide lockdowns are done, governments can make sensible trade-offs—banning large indoor gatherings, say and allowing the reopening of schools and shops. Sometimes, as in some American states, they will loosen too much and have to reverse course. Others will learn from their mistakes.The problem is that, without a cure or a vaccine, containment depends on people learning to change their behaviour. After the initial covid-19 panic, many are becoming disenchanted and resistant. Masks help stop the disease, but in Europe and America some refuse to wear one because they see them as emasculating or, worse, Democratic. Thorough handwashing kills the virus, but who has not relapsed into bad old habits? Parties are dangerous but young people cooped up for months have developed a devil-may-care attitude. Most important, as the months drag on, people just need to earn some money. In the autumn, as life moves indoors, infections could soar.Changing social norms is hard. Just look at aids, known for decades to be prevented by safe sex and clean needles. Yet in 2018, 1.7m people were newly infected with hiv, the virus that causes it. Covid-19 is easier to talk about than aids, but harder to avoid. Wearing a mask is chiefly about protecting others; the young, fit and asymptomatic are being asked to follow tedious rules to shield the old and infirm.Changing behaviour requires clear communication from trusted figures, national and local. But many people do not believe their politicians. In countries such as America, Iran, Britain, Russia and Brazil, which have the highest caseloads, presidents and prime ministers minimised the threat, vacillated, issued bad advice or seemed more interested in their own political fortunes than in their country—sometimes all at once.Covid-19 is here for a while at least. The vulnerable will be afraid to go out and innovation will slow, creating a 90% economy that consistently fails to reach its potential. Many people will fall ill and some of them will die. You may have lost interest in the pandemic. It has not lost interest in you. ■Editor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter.

covid19,RE:Are HIV patients high risk for COVID19? Or do antiretrovirals have a protective effect?,Source: askscienceForum: AskScience Forum,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/hl782i/are_hiv_patients_high_risk_for_covid19_or_do/fwxfw4y/,"HIV antiretrovirals only destroy retroviruses. COVID19 is a coronavirus therefore antiretroviral medications do NOT have a protective effect on COVID19.HIV patients do not have an increased risk for COVID19 if they are currently undetectable and have an acceptable/normal amount of CD4 cells.Further to this; though some anti-HIV medications are being studied to treat or prevent COVID-19, there is no evidence yet that they work.To date lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) and tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada), were thought may be effective but updates from trials have not shown effectiveness.To expand upon, someone who is undetectable is someone under treatment. They take their meds on time and regularly, and go get tested two-to-four times a year. Someone who is undetectable is also uninfectious, which is why civilized nations subsidize or cover HIV treatment.Someone who is not being treated, whose virus is resistant to current treatment, or who is unable to maintain the drug regimen, will be susceptible to their CD4 count falling, which means their immune system becomes more vulnerable. Such a person will be more vulnerable to COVID and other infections and will be infectious; the higher your virus level, the more infectious you are.MembersOnline"
