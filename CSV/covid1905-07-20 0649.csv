covid19,Why Some Young People Fear Social Isolation More Than COVID-19,NPR,https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&sa=t&url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/07/04/885546281/why-some-young-people-fear-social-isolation-more-than-covid-19&ct=ga&cd=CAAYADIdZmQyNzJjNDk4NjUwYWNmYzpjb20uc2c6ZW46U0c&usg=AFQjCNEQDUJ5af7sX7Q9TYfN07VMWw63YA,"YUKI NOGUCHIRecent protests in Philadelphia and across the country have drawn young people. But for most of the pandemic, youth have been quarantined and away from their social circles, which could make depression and other mental illness worse.Audrey just turned 18 and relishes crossing into adulthood: She voted for the first time this year, graduated high school and is college-bound next month. The honors student typically wakes up ""a bundle of nerves,"" she says, which had fueled her work volunteering, playing varsity sports and leading student government.But for years, she also struggled with anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder — all of which drove her to work harder.""I was spending so much time on my homework, I felt like I was losing my friends — so my thoughts would race over and over again about my friends,"" says Audrey. ""And then I would have the difficult thoughts about suicide and some scarier stuff."" (NPR agreed to use only her first name to protect her medical privacy.)Audrey's psychological struggles landed her in mental health treatment last fall. There, she says, the coping skills she learned gave her perspective on quarantine: ""I know all about how seeing friends and seeing people outside — and social interaction — is vital for survival.""There is a simmering tension between young people's desire to gather socially, and the growing threat from the coronavirus in the United States. The virus is now infecting more people in their teens and 20s than it had earlier in the pandemic, and that's contributing to outbreaks, especially in states in the South and West. As a result, public health officials are imploring young adults to limit social contact and take precautions to help protect their more vulnerable elders. But many young people see continued social isolation as a much greater risk than COVID-19 to their own mental health.It's not that Audrey isn't worried about the pandemic; in fact, confirmed cases of the coronavirus are spiking in her hometown of Charlotte, N.C. So Audrey wears masks, washes her hands and stays 6 feet from friends. But for her generation, she says, infection isn't the primary threat.""A lot of people are calling attention to coronavirus because it's right in front of us,"" she says. ""But at the same time, teens' depression rate — it's a silent threat.""The health risks of infection differ by generation. For many young adults, life lived at a social distance, with a lack of peer support, comes at a high cost to mental health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says nearly half of people between 18 and 29 report feeling symptoms of anxiety or depression. That's significantly higher that the rate for both their parents and their grandparents. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for people under 35.Yet somehow, says Audrey, that's not talked about as much.""We haven't seen the government or adults as passionate about the things we really care about, like mental health and climate issues,"" she says.It might be tempting to think that FaceTime and Zoom provide substitutes for in-person social outlets, especially for a generation of digital natives who grew up with smartphones. But, therapists say, talking by small screen offers no replacement for a calming hug and can miss the subtleties of a compassionate expression.Audrey's complaint is a common refrain among the adolescent and young adult patients whom psychologist Lisa Jacobs counsels. It is not that they aren't concerned about the risks of COVID-19, she says; it's just that their risk calculations differ.""They are appropriately realizing that isolation is a risk for them as well — it's a risk factor for depression, and depression is a risk factor for suicide,"" Jacobs says. ""And 8% of American teens attempt suicide each year.""Jacobs says many of her young patients complain older generations failed to address the young people's fears — of school shootings and climate change, for example.""After not being protected, after not being taken seriously, they were asked to take extreme measures to protect other groups and to put themselves at risk by doing so,"" Jacobs says.There is a biological basis for young people's need for socialization. Scientists say bonding isn't a luxury; it's critical for development.Young brains need social connection to feel secure about their identity and place in the world, says Gregory Lewis, who studies the neurobiology of social interaction at Indiana University.If You Need Help: ResourcesIf you or someone you know is in crisis, help is available. Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255, or go here to chat online.For more help:""We expect as a human being to have other people there to share the stressful times and to be our backup, and when they're not there physically, that in of itself tells our nervous system 'you're in a dangerous environment because you don't have these people here,' "" he says.That is less of an issue among older adults, Lewis says, who have had more time to develop their social networks — both at work and around their community — and more time to find partners who can help ground them emotionally. By contrast, he says, ""younger people are missing a larger percentage of what previously was there to buffer them.""So the societal challenge, he says, is to find ways to help community members of all ages balance the risks of infection against the need to foster those essential social bonds.NPR thanks our sponsorsBecome an NPR sponsor"

covid19,"Several US states report record COVID-19 cases, curfew ordered in Miami",CNA,https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&sa=t&url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/covid-19-coronavirus-us-record-cases-curfew-miami-12900348&ct=ga&cd=CAAYAjIdZmQyNzJjNDk4NjUwYWNmYzpjb20uc2c6ZW46U0c&usg=AFQjCNFrnof6hyRJjR86rG6UNIkOHw6AFQ,"WASHINGTON: Alabama and several other states reported record increases in coronavirus cases on Friday (Jul 3) as Florida's most populous county imposed a curfew ahead of the Independence Day weekend and Arkansas joined a push towards mandating mask-wearing in public.North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alaska, Missouri, Idaho and Alabama all saw new daily highs in cases of COVID-19. Texas hit a new peak for hospitalisations, with one doctor calling for a ""complete lockdown"" in the state to get the virus under control.The daily US tally of cases stood at 53,483 late on Friday, below the previous day's record 55,405.The recent surge, most pronounced in southern and western states, has alarmed public health officials, who urged caution ahead of a Jul 4 holiday weekend to celebrate the Declaration of Independence of the United States in 1776.North Carolina reported 951 hospitalisations and 2,099 cases, both record highs.Bill Saffo, mayor of Wilmington, North Carolina, said many infections had been traced to large gatherings and predicted a further jump after the holiday weekend as people flouted guidelines on social distancing and masks.""We know that the spread is going to happen. We know probably in about two weeks we'll see a spike from the Jul 4 weekend,"" Saffo told CNN.Despite the jump in infections, the daily death rate in the United States has remained relatively flat, a reflection of the growing proportion of positive tests among younger, healthier people who are less prone to severe outcomes.However, US Surgeon General Jerome Adams warned that the impact on fatalities from the recent surge, which started in mid-June, had yet to be seen. ""Deaths lag at least two weeks and can lag even more,"" he told Fox & Friends on Friday.His remarks came hours ahead of a trip by President Donald Trump to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota, where he is expected to give a speech to thousands of supporters in which he will rail against the ""left wing mob"" and view a fireworks display at the landmark depicting four US presidents in stone.The visit has drawn criticism from Native Americans, who say the remote area is sacred to them, as well as health experts who discourage large congregations of people.Trump, whose handling of the pandemic has come under harsh criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, has repeatedly sought to dismiss the jump in cases as a function of more tests and again this week predicted the virus would ""disappear"".MORE MASKSCoronavirus cases are rising in 37 of the 50 US states including Florida, which had 9,488 new cases on Friday, according to the state health department. Florida's 10,109 cases on Thursday was a record for the state and more than any European country's daily peak at the height of the outbreak there.Evidence that the surge is not simply due to expanded testing, the percentage of tests coming back positive in Florida has hit 16 per cent, up from 4 per cent a month ago, according to a Reuters analysis. The World Health Organization says a rate over 5 per cent is concerning.Against that backdrop, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez imposed an indefinite nightly curfew starting on Friday and halted the reopenings of entertainment venues such as casinos and strip clubs. Earlier this week, Miami-Dade and neighbouring Broward County, the state's two most populous counties, required residents to wear face coverings in public.Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson on Friday authorised the state's cities and towns to enact a ""model ordinance"" requiring the wearing of face coverings if they choose to do so, becoming the latest Republican to relent to pressure on the issue.The move came a day after Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered that face masks be worn in most public places, reversing his stance following an alarming rise in infections in the state, which on Friday marked a new high for hospitalisations at 7,652.Owais Durrani, a resident at University Hospital in San Antonio, said nearly all the patients coming into the emergency room tested positive for COVID-19 – even those admitted for unrelated issues such as gall bladder infections.""We, in my opinion, need to go into a complete lockdown and we're still going to see an increase in all of those metrics for two to three weeks and then maybe we turn a corner,"" he said.Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright© Mediacorp 2020.
