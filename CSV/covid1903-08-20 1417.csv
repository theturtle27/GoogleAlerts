A news report by Russia‚Äôs Tass news agency in the second week of July had said that this candidate vaccine had entered phase-II of clinical trials on July 13. Phase-II trials, in which the vaccine is tested for its ability to trigger immune response in human beings, usually takes a few months to be completed. Read in TamilBut because of the prevailing Covid19 emergency, vaccine developments across the globe are being fast-tracked. Yet, the Russian vaccine has raised concerns because of the speed at which it is being pushed through. It is most likely to be approved without phase-III trials being carried out. Phase-III trials assess whether the vaccine works in real life situations, essentially whether it offers protection to the people against the disease for which it is being developed. Phase-III trials are usually carried out on several thousand volunteers, and takes months or years to be completed.Also read | Why are so many vaccines being developed? Shouldn‚Äôt everyone collaborate to produce just one effective vaccine?Some earlier news reports from Russia had indicated that phase-III trials would be carried out alongside the deployment of the vaccine for public use. But there was no mention of this fact on Saturday.The completion of trials are no guarantee of a vaccine getting the approval of the regulator to be used on public. Data generated by human trials are assessed in detail, and in most cases, fail to convince the regulator. Vaccines have a very poor rate of getting approved by regulatory authorities. Only a very small number of vaccines that are developed actually get the approval to be used. In the case of the Russian Coronavirus vaccine, however, a regulatory approval is being taken almost for granted.Also read | An Expert Explains: Should you test for Covid-19 just to check?Because of these reasons, there is some amount of scepticism with regard to the Russian vaccine. This scepticism was expressed by top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci as well, during his testimony to a panel of US lawmakers on Friday.‚ÄúI do hope that the Chinese and the Russians are actually testing the vaccines before they are administering the vaccine to anyone. Because claims of having a vaccine ready to distribute before you do testing is problematic at the very least,‚Äù Fauci said.In China, one Coronavirus vaccine has already been approved for limited use after completion of phase-II trials. This is being administered only to military personnel for the time being. At least seven Chinese candidates are currently being tested on human beings.üì£ Express Explained is now on Telegram.

Starting Sunday night for the next six weeks, the city's residents will face a curfew from 8pm to 5am. They will also not be able to go further than 5km from their home and will be limited to an hour of exercise a day.Only one person per household will be able to shop for essential items each day, also within the same 5km radius.Most school and university students in Melbourne will return to online learning from midnight on Wednesday, just weeks after returning to their classrooms, while kindergartens and daycare centres will be effectively closed from Thursday.Supermarkets will remain open, and restaurants, already closed for dining in, will be able to continue with their takeaway and delivery services.Weddings will also be banned in the city. At the height of the first wave of the pandemic, weddings in Australia were limited to five people.""These are the decisions made because anything short of this will not keep us safe,"" Andrews said.""Anything short of this will see it drag on for months and months and months.""Additional restrictions affecting workplaces would be announced on Monday, Andrews added, suggesting that non-essential businesses will face closures.The state recorded 671 new COVID-19 cases and seven deaths from the virus on Sunday.FEDERAL BACKINGThe federal government backed Victoria's measures, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying in a post on his Facebook page that they were ""regrettably necessary"" to stop the spread of the pandemic.""We are all in this together and we will get through it,"" Morrison said.Australia's Health Minister Greg Hunt said at a televised briefing the federal government supports the measures with a ""heavy"" heart.""We do so because they will help save and protect lives,"" Hunt said.The backing by the federal government, ruled by a Liberal Party-led coalition, for the measures by Victoria's Labor Party government shows national unity across the political spectrum in a country with a loose federal system.The state of disaster gives Victoria police additional powers to ensure people are complying with public health directions.""We have no choice but to make these decisions and to push on,"" Andrews said. ""This is the only option we have.""Outside Melbourne, the rest of Victoria will move to a Stage 3 lockdown from midnight on Wednesday with people allowed to leave home only for work, study, care and essential shopping.Elsewhere in Australia, other states and territories have for weeks reported zero or a small number of cases while relaxing restrictions.They have, however, banned visitors from Victoria and Sydney - another virus hotspot.Australia's total reported COVID-19 infections reached almost 18,000 on Sunday, with 208 deaths in a population of 25 million.Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright¬© Mediacorp 2020.

Last modified on Mon 3 Aug 2020A Guardian Australia analysis of coronavirus cases in Victoria shows where infections have been increasing, and where Covid-19 cases are on the decline.Using data aggregated daily from the dashboard of the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) here, we calculate the number of new cases a day for every local government area in Victoria.We then check to see if cases have increased or decreased over the past fortnight for each area that reported more than five cases during that period (see below for more details on the trend method used).Here‚Äôs the full map:The map is updated daily to track changes in each area over time.You can use the buttons to show the previously locked-down postcode areas, which can overlap with multiple local government areas.Map notesThis analysis is based on a daily scrape of LGA data from the DHHS dashboard. To get an idea if cases are increasing or decreasing over the fortnight, I‚Äôve used the weekly change from a rolling seven-day average of daily new cases over the past 14 days. Because case counts can be adjusted retrospectively by DHHS, daily counts can be negative. These are set to zero for the purposes of the trend.Please let me know if there are any issues with the map or data here: australia.coronatracking@theguardian.comBelow you can find all our Victorian coronavirus data, which is also available on our full Australia Covid-19 map and stats page.Here you can see the total number of daily cases, split by those where the source of the infection was overseas, and those where it was acquired locally or still under investigation.Here, you can see the trend in the source of Covid-19 cases over the whole length of the coronavirus pandemic in Victoria:Here‚Äôs a more detailed breakdown for recent cases only, showing the number of cases each day that are from a known or unknown source, as well as those that are under investigation:As the Victorian government increases testing, we might expect to see a rise in cases. This chart shows the percentage of positive cases per the number of tests conducted for both Victoria and NSW. A lower % positive rate is indicative of more widespread, less-targeted testing.Generally the % positive rate in Australia is lower than many other countries, well below the threshold that the WHO has reccomended for adequate testing.Nick EvershedMon 3 Aug 2020 03.09 BST

covid19,Covid-19: government 'considers indoor mixing ban and M25 block' in England,The Guardian,https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&sa=t&url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/02/covid-19-government-considers-indoor-mixing-ban-and-m25-block-in-england&ct=ga&cd=CAAYBDIdZmQyNzJjNDk4NjUwYWNmYzpjb20uc2c6ZW46U0c&usg=AFQjCNFCpCWb2ZXSCZ262_eEzcxX9gNGaQ,"Government reportedly exploring range of measures to stop Covid-19 infections risingSarah Boseley Health editorSun 2 Aug 2020 16.10 BST
Last modified on Mon 3 Aug 2020The UK government is reported to be exploring a range of measures to stop infections rising and keep Covid-19 in check in England ‚Äì some of them for use in the event of regional spikes, such as those in Leicester and Oldham, and others that would affect the entire country in the event that case numbers surge more generally. Here are some possible options that may be on the table, according to the reports, which Downing Street sources said were merely ‚Äúspeculative‚Äù.This is the nuclear option for the whole of England and likely to be highly unpopular, although this time, shielding would be individually targeted and not uniquely based on age. It has been pointed out that some over-70s are very fit without underlying health conditions. The idea is to give people over 50 an assessment of their particular risk, which is possible now because of greater information on survival. People at lower risk would be free to go out and live life relatively normally, which could cause resentment. People shielding might be offered specific times when they could go to the shops without meeting those who are mixing freely.Until now, the shielding list has been limited to people with certain conditions, such as some cancers where the immune system is affected by treatment and severe lung conditions such as cystic fibrosis. Those people were told that they could return to work and go outside as much as they like from 1 August, while maintaining social distancing.The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said reports that expanded shielding for over-50s was being considered were ‚Äújust speculation‚Äù.To stop a major surge in London spreading across the country, ministers could advise no travel for Londoners past the M25, effectively isolating the capital city. In practice this would be almost impossible to police and highly disruptive for the 9 million people living in the city. It would have to take the form of guidance rather than an edict and could lead to anger against any Londoners found elsewhere in the country. Jenrick also dismissed reports about this measure being on the table as speculation.Households have been told not to meet up with other people in the towns affected by the rise in cases in the north of England. The government‚Äôs test-and-trace programme has provided data suggesting it is family get-togethers that are responsible, rather than people going back to work or going shopping. A national rise in cases could see that ban extended across the country.In the event of another surge of infections in London, a blanket quarantine policy could be imposed for anyone flying in to the country. The rationale is that the major airports are in London and that the transport system, including trains, the tube and buses, allows the virus to move swiftly between people. At the moment, everyone returning from Spain and Luxembourg must quarantine for 14 days and it is thought Belgium may join that list.‚Ä¶ joining us from Singapore, we have a small favour to ask.

Don't lose hope. We are aware that you are tired,"" Duterte said late on Sunday, addressing the medical frontliners during a televised speech after meeting cabinet members and his coronavirus task force.The Philippines recorded 5,032 additional infections on Sunday, the country's largest single-day increase, taking its confirmed coronavirus cases to 103,185. The death toll jumped by 20 to 2,059.This is the second highest number of COVID-19 infections and deaths in Southeast Asia, behind Indonesia.Duterte also approved the hiring of 10,000 medical professionals to beef up the current workforce and additional benefits for healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients, Roque said.In mid-March, Duterte imposed one of the world's longest and strictest lockdowns in the capital and other provinces to curb the coronavirus spread.He began easing restrictions in June in an effort to revive the domestic economy, which is now facing its biggest contraction in more than three decades.

covid19,"Cramped workplaces, parties ‚Ä¶ the factors fuelling local Covid-19 spikes",The Guardian,https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&sa=t&url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/02/cramped-workplaces-parties-the-factors-fuelling-local-covid-19-spikes&ct=ga&cd=CAAYBjIdZmQyNzJjNDk4NjUwYWNmYzpjb20uc2c6ZW46U0c&usg=AFQjCNFhFvmfXjT9TmSkdy5tuXKg1OsLDw,"What have resurgences around the world taught us about how local clusters emerge?Emma Graham-HarrisonSun 2 Aug 2020 08.23 BSTIt is not always possible to pinpoint the origin of a local spike in cases, particularly in countries like the UK, where the disease is still circulating at relatively significant levels.But in countries where overall caseloads are lower, and with rigorous test-and-trace schemes, it has been possible to pinpoint the factors that have sparked or fuelled local outbreaks.Hong Kong‚Äôs recent spike in Covid-19 cases ‚Äì more than 100 new cases for nine days in a row ‚Äì is thought to have been caused in part by visitors who were given exemptions from its otherwise strict quarantine rules, which require new arrivals to spend 14 days in isolation.About 200,000 people, including boat and plane crews, and executives of listed companies, were allowed to enter the city without quarantine. Authorities said that they needed to come and go to keep the city or its economy going. It is a global air-hub, and relies on imported food.The country had brought in the travel restrictions to halt a second wave of infections in March, and they had been largely effective. But the latest outbreaks suggest that they need to be comprehensive if they are to keep infections down.In both South Korea and France, a local spike in infections has been linked to nightclubs. Last week a seaside resort on the Brittany coast reported dozens of infections, mostly among 18- to 25-year-olds. Contact-tracing suggested that the outbreak began with a single summer worker.The now-infected worker had gathered with others at a disco, which had been allowed to reopen after blocking off the dance floor with tables. Government officials have attacked the ‚Äúirresponsibility of young people‚Äù.In Seoul in May, a 29-year-old man was also linked to dozens of new cases after he visited five nightclubs. Authorities responded by clamping down on nightlife venues.Meat-processing plants, where people work in cramped conditions, have served as incubators for the disease in more than one country.In Germany, in June, more than 1,500 workers were infected at a slaughterhouse in North Rhine-Westphalia. In the US, multiple Covid-19 hotspots have been linked to meat-processing plants, where poultry, pigs and cattle are slaughtered and packaged, from Kansas to Missouri and Nebraska.And last month, a significant outbreak in Beijing was linked to the city‚Äôs largest wholesale market and a government food-safety inspection body.Singapore appeared to have brought the disease rapidly under control at the start of the year, and was hailed as an early success story.But Covid-19 was still spreading rapidly among migrant workers living in dormitories, often 10 to 20 to a room, who were not able to follow social distancing guidelines. The city state has now recorded more than 50,000 cases, and those workers account for the vast majority.The government responded with a quarantine and testing regime, which has so far covered 250,000 workers; it expects to complete testing in August and forecasts that cases will then drop.These have been identified as a driver of wider outbreaks ‚Äì but also a source of local spikes ‚Äì since the early days of the pandemic. South Korea was one of the first countries outside China to have a major outbreak, and many of its cases were traced back to services at a megachurch.Despite that, mass gatherings continue in countries with known coronavirus cases ‚Äì in the UK this month several infections were traced to a single crowded pub in Staffordshire.‚Ä¶ joining us from Singapore, we have a small favour to ask.

""What we are seeing today is different from March and April. It is extraordinarily widespread"" in rural as well as urban areas.""To everybody who lives in a rural area: You are not immune or protected from this virus,"" Birx said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""Birx, the White House task force coordinator, said people living in multigenerational households in an area that is experiencing an outbreak should wear masks inside the home to protect the elderly or those with underlying conditions.Admiral Brett Giroir, an assistant Health and Human Services secretary, continued to stress the importance of wearing masks.""If we don't do that, and if we don't limit the indoor crowded spaces, the virus will continue to run,"" he said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""""We are very concerned and this is a very serious point.""The coronavirus, which first appeared in China, has infected 4.6 million people in the United States and killed more than 155,000 Americans, according to a Reuters tally.Birx said federal officials have been working on individual reports for each state examining community trends and hospital records. ""Each of these responses have to be dramatically tailored,"" she said.She said what she witnessed as she visited 14 states over the last three weeks gave her cause for concern.""As I travelled around the country, I saw all of America moving,"" Birx said. ""If you have chosen to go on vacation into a hot spot, you really need to come back and protect those with comorbidities and assume you're infected.""If people wear masks and avoid crowds, Giroir said, it gives the same outcome as a complete shutdown.""That's why we're going to all the states, we're on local radio, we give specific instructions to every governor by county, what they need to do when we start - when those counties start tipping yellow, because that's the time when you have to stamp it down,"" he said.Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright¬© Mediacorp 2020.

covid19,"'Wrong!' Trump and Fauci clash over surge in COVID-19 cases, reopening of economy ‚Äî and ...",MarketWatch,https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&sa=t&url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wrong-trump-and-fauci-clash-over-the-resurgence-of-covid-19-cases-shutdown-of-us-economy-and-hydroxychloroquine-2020-08-02&ct=ga&cd=CAAYCTIdZmQyNzJjNDk4NjUwYWNmYzpjb20uc2c6ZW46U0c&usg=AFQjCNH6LppfHHa-mS1UcCdsDYSEWXvcnQ,"Anthony Fauci and President Trump are still at odds.Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for three decade who has worked on the front lines of the AIDS pandemic in the 1980s and 1990s, the Ebola outbreak of 2014 to 2016 and the anthrax attacks two decades ago, testified before Congress last week that the U.S. should have taken speedier and more comprehensive action to close businesses when coronavirus first appeared in the U.S. earlier this year.Fauci said the U.S. effectively only shut down half the economy. ‚ÄúIf you look at what happened in Europe when they shut down, or locked down, or went to shelter-in-place, however you want to describe it, they really did it to the tune of about 95% plus,‚Äù he told the hearing. ‚ÄúWhen you actually look at what we did, even though we shut down, even though it created a great deal of difficulty, we really functionally shut down only about 50% in the sense of the totality of the country.‚ÄùPresident Trump hit back at Fauci on Twitter TWTR, -0.87% on Saturday evening, replying to a post by CBS News VIAC, +1.00% of Fauci‚Äôs testimony. ‚ÄúWrong! We have more cases because we have tested far more than any other country, 60,000,000. If we tested less, there would be less cases. How did Italy, France & Spain do? Now Europe sadly has flare ups. Most of our governors worked hard & smart. We will come back STRONG!‚ÄùNearly 53 million people have been tested for coronavirus in the U.S. to date, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with more than 5 million or 10% of those testing positive for the virus. Wait times of more than 10 days have become the norm for many Americans. There are, however, stories of people who have had to wait 26 days to get their results. Waiting 10 days for a test defeats the purpose of getting tested, some health professionals say.Approximately half of the tests being performed daily are conducted by commercial labs such as Quest Diagnostics DGX, +0.24% and LabCorp. ‚ÄúOnly one state has an average turnaround time of greater than five days,‚Äù said Admiral Brett Giroir, a member of the White House coronavirus task force.‚Äù Five states are between four and five days. 26 states are still three days or less, and the rest are between three and four days.‚Äù Turnaround times of 10 to 12 days represent outliers, he added.The Trump administration, meanwhile, is trying to block $25 billion for states to conduct testing and contact tracing in the next coronavirus relief bill, people involved in the talks told the Washington Post this month. Democratic lawmakers, in negotiations over a new stimulus bill, have demanded $25 billion for the testing and contact-tracing, over three times what the GOP have suggested. Contact tracing identifies people who someone with COVID-19 has come into contact with.At the U.S. House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, Fauci reiterated that there was no scientific evidence to show that hydroxychloroquine was helpful for coronavirus patients. ‚ÄúYou look at the scientific data and the evidence, and the scientific data, on trials that are valid that were randomized and controlled in the proper way; all of those trials show consistently that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment of coronavirus disease or COVID-19.‚ÄùWhen asked by Republican Rep. Blaine Leutkemeyer from Missouri about a ‚Äúpeer-reviewed‚Äù study suggesting otherwise, Fauci said, ‚ÄúThe Henry Ford Hospital study that was published was a non-controlled retrospective cohort study that was confounded by a number of issues, including the fact that many people who were receiving hydroxychloroquine were also using corticosteroids, which we know from another study gives a clear benefit in reducing deaths with advanced disease.‚Äù‚ÄùSo that study is a flawed study, and I think anyone who examines it carefully [would see] that it is not a randomized placebo-controlled trial. You can peer review something that‚Äôs a bad study,‚Äù Fauci said, adding, ‚ÄúI would be the first one to admit it and to promote it, but I have not seen yet a randomized placebo controlled trial that‚Äôs done that. I don‚Äôt have any horse in the game one way or the other. I just look at the data.‚ÄùSocial-media sites attempted to quash a video pushing misleading information about hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment ‚Äî which led to Twitter partially suspending Donald Trump Jr.‚Äôs account. The video featured doctors calling hydroxychloroquine ‚Äî a drug used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis for decades ‚Äî ‚Äúa cure for COVID‚Äù, despite a growing body of scientific evidence that has not shown this to be true.As of Sunday, COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, had infected at least 17.9 million people globally and 4.6 million in the U.S. It had killed over 686,877 people worldwide and at least 154,793 in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University. Cases in California surpassed 500,000 as the state reported 7,118 new cases Saturday, with 134 new deaths, bringing the death toll in that state to 9,365. New York has the most fatalities (32,710) followed by New Jersey (15,836).The Dow Jones Industrial Index DJIA, +0.43% closed higher Friday, as investors tracked round two of the potential fiscal stimulus. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.76% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.48% also ended the week after some of the industry‚Äôs largest and most powerful players ‚Äî Apple AAPL, +10.46% Facebook FB, +8.17%, Amazon. AMZN, +3.69% and Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -3.27% GOOG, -3.16% ‚Äî reported their results.Related:Dr. Fauci tells MarketWatch: I would not get on a plane or eat inside a restaurantHealth professionals, economists and lawmakers are concerned about the rise in coronavirus over the last month with the rise in daily cases exceeding 1,000 for the sixth consecutive day on Saturday. The U.S. cannot afford to have a resurgence of the virus either now or in the fall, health professionals say. For one, it‚Äôs harder to get people to practice social distancing and stay home again, especially after they‚Äôve already abided by stay-at-home orders for more than 11 weeks.Secondly, the effect on the economy could push the U.S. into a prolonged recession, even greater than the one already predicted by some economists, despite some observers seeing public health and economic health as an either/or scenario. Thirdly, the flu season will already be upon us in the winter and those symptoms are easily confused with those of COVID-19. Fourthly, too few people will be immune to COVID-19 after this first wave ends to support herd immunity.Another thing to consider: Given the age profile of fatalities in the U.S. and other countries, elderly people would die in far greater numbers if the economy were restarted earlier. Paul Zak, a neuroscientist and author of ‚ÄúThe Moral Molecule: The Source of Love and Prosperity,‚Äù said a trade-off between the economy and allowing (older) people to die of COVID-19 reflects that society values people on their economic output, which ignores a multitude of other factors.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs appalling to attach a dollar number to a human life ‚Äî for non-economists,‚Äù Colin Camerer, a professor of behavioral finance and economics at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, told MarketWatch. ‚ÄúYou can never make things perfectly safe with zero risk. We do have limited time, health-care staff, ventilators and money. What is the curve of transmission? How many people are going to die, if you open up the economy? No one is really too sure.‚ÄùTrump has said he is also concerned about the impact of the pandemic and job losses on people‚Äôs mental health; some studies suggest it could lead to tragic outcomes. The growing epidemic of ‚Äúdeaths of despair‚Äù in the U.S. is also increasing due to the pandemic ‚Äî and another 75,000 more people will likely die from drug or alcohol misuse and suicide, according to research from the Well Being Trust, and Robert Graham Center at the American Academy of Family Physicians.The response to the virus has been split down political lines. The American public has responded differently to the pandemic along political lines: 62% of Republicans and Republican leaners say the seriousness of COVID-19 is ‚Äúgenerally exaggerated,‚Äù according to one survey, while just 31% of Democrats and Democrat leaners and 35% of independents say the same. Democrats and independents are more likely than Republicans that coronavirus is a threat.How COVID-19 is transmittedShould you wear eye protection to fend off COVID-19?

But the daily number of new infections has been in three digits for the past 12 days.Members of the testing team, co-ordinated by the Chinese government, are mostly from public hospitals in Guangdong province, China's National Health Commission said.A group of local Hong Kong councillors said on Sunday that some local residents fear China may use their presence as an opportunity to collect DNA samples for surveillance purposes.The territory's government denied the claims, saying virus testing would only be conducted in the city and samples would not be transported to the mainland.Leader Carrie Lam said on Saturday the former British colony asked for help from the central government due to the resurgence in cases. She said the government was studying whether everyone in Hong Kong could be tested, local broadcaster RTHK reported on Saturday.The Chinese territory saw a surge in locally transmitted coronavirus cases in July and introduced a raft of tightening measures including restricting gatherings to two people and mandating face masks in all outdoor public spaces.Hong Kong has reported around 3,400 coronavirus cases and 33 deaths since January, far lower than other major cities around the world. But the daily number of new infections has been in the triple-digits for the past 11 days.Beijing recently imposed a security law that critics say undermines Hong Kong's autonomy, which was guaranteed under a ""one country, two systems"" formula when the city returned to Chinese control from Britain in 1997.Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright¬© Mediacorp 2020.

covid19,"When it comes to Covid-19 vaccines, rich nations are first in line",The Straits Times,https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&sa=t&url=https://www.straitstimes.com/world/when-it-comes-to-covid-19-vaccines-rich-nations-are-first-in-line&ct=ga&cd=CAAYCzIdZmQyNzJjNDk4NjUwYWNmYzpjb20uc2c6ZW46U0c&usg=AFQjCNH0vnJs3A16EQ1_5NsyKiodX2nJ6A,"WASHINGTON (BLOOMBERG) - Wealthy countries have already locked up more than a billion doses of coronavirus vaccines, raising worries that the rest of the world will be at the back of the queue in the global effort to defeat the pathogen.Moves by the United States and Britain to secure supplies from Sanofi and partner GlaxoSmithKline, and another pact between Japan and Pfizer, are the latest in a string of agreements. The European Union has also been aggressive in obtaining shots, well before anyone knows whether they will work.Although international groups and a number of nations are promising to make vaccines affordable and accessible to all, doses will likely struggle to keep up with demand in a world of roughly 7.8 billion people.The possibility that wealthier countries will monopolise supply, a scenario that played out in the 2009 swine flu pandemic, has fuelled concern among poor nations and health advocates.The US, Britain, EU and Japan have so far secured about 1.3 billion doses of potential Covid-19 immunisations, according to London-based analytics firm Airfinity. Options to snap up additional supplies or pending deals would add more than 1.5 billion doses to that total, its figures show.""Even if you have an optimistic assessment of the scientific progress, there's still not enough vaccines for the world,"" according to Mr Rasmus Bech Hansen, Airfinity's chief executive officer. What is also important to consider is that most of the vaccines may require two doses, he said.A few front runners, such as the University of Oxford and partner AstraZeneca and a Pfizer-BioNTech collaboration, are already in final-stage studies, fuelling hopes that a weapon to fight Covid-19 will be available soon.But developers must still clear a number of hurdles: proving their shots are effective, gaining approval and ramping up manufacturing.Worldwide supply may not reach one billion doses until the first quarter of 2022, Airfinity forecasts.Investing in production capacity all over the world is seen as one of the keys to solving the dilemma, and pharma companies are starting to outline plans to deploy shots widely.Sanofi and Glaxo intend to provide a significant portion of worldwide capacity in 2021 and 2022 to a global initiative that is focused on accelerating development and production and distributing shots equitably.The World Health Organisation, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance are working together to bring about equitable and broad access. They outlined a US$18 billion (S$24.7 billion) plan in June to roll out shots and secure two billion doses by the end of 2021.The initiative, known as Covax, aims to give governments an opportunity to hedge the risk of backing unsuccessful candidates and give other nations with limited finances access to shots that would be otherwise unaffordable.Countries would need to strike a series of different agreements with vaccine makers to raise their chances of getting supplies, as some shots would not succeed, a situation that could lead to bidding battles and inefficiencies, Mr Seth Berkley, Gavi's CEO, said in an interview.""The thing we worry about most is getting a tangle of deals,"" he said. ""Our hope is with a portfolio of vaccines we can get countries to come together.""Some 78 nations have expressed interest in joining Covax, he said. In addition, more than 90 low- and middle-income countries and economies will be able to access Covid-19 vaccines through a Gavi-led programme, the group said last Friday. There is still concern the rest of the world might fall behind.""That is exactly what we're trying to avoid,"" Mr Berkley said.AstraZeneca in June became the first manufacturer to sign up to Gavi's programme, committing 300 million doses, and Pfizer and BioNTech signalled interest in potentially supplying Covax.The Trump administration agreed to provide as much as US$2.1 billion to partners Sanofi and Glaxo, the biggest US investment yet for Operation Warp Speed, the nation's vaccine development and procurement programme.The funding will support clinical trials and manufacturing while allowing the US to secure 100 million doses, if it is successful. The country has an option to receive an additional 500 million doses longer term.The EU is closing in on a deal for as many as 300 million doses of the Sanofi-Glaxo shot and is in advanced discussions with several other companies, according to a statement last Friday.""The European Commission is also committed to ensuring that everyone who needs a vaccine gets it, anywhere in the world and not only at home,"" it said.The US has invested in a number of other projects. Pfizer and BioNTech last week reached a US$1.95 billion deal to supply their vaccine to the government, should regulators clear it. Novavax earlier this month announced a US$1.6 billion deal, while the US earlier pledged as much as US$1.2 billion to AstraZeneca to spur development and production.US investment to speed up trials, scale up manufacturing and boost vaccine development is ""great news for the world"", assuming vaccines are shared, Mr Berkley said.""It helps drive the science forward,"" he said. ""On that, I'm very positive. My concern is that we need global supply.""SPH Digital News / Copyright ¬© 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. Co. Regn. No. 198402868E. All rights reserved"

covid19,Need a hotel with good COVID19 safety procedures,Source: TripAdvisor ForumsForum: Fredericksburg,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g60824-i1183-k13338326-Need_a_hotel_with_good_COVID19_safety_procedures-Fredericksburg_Virginia.html,"I may stop in Fredericksburg VA in October. I have been reading all the TA reviews of hotels in Fredericksburg VA. I am very focused on COVID19 safety procedures. I would appreciate a recommendation for a hotel where you believe the COVID19 safety procedures were good. Thank you.My experience with recent hotel stays has shown that extra sanitizing is based on management concern for everyone's well-being and how diligent the housekeeping staff is on any given day. Take some wipes and do certain surfaces like door knobs and bathroom. I had no qualms about linen. However good the place is rated, is how good the extra effort will be. Tip the housekeeper well, with an atta-person added, for best results the next day. Stick with the CDC rules to CYA.In F'burg, we stay at the Sleep Inn Southpointe, just off I-95 at the south end of town, 10 minutes from downtown, and have been for the last 5 years when I was up doing research. Its in a commercial development behind another Choice Hotel, away from noise, and near a bunch of restaurants although we usually eat at the Colonial Tavern(pub) or Paradise Diner(Greek/American menu and a dynamite mousse mouse) on the Warrenton Rd.Hi bassbum - Thank you for your reply and suggestion. The way things are going with the coronavirus, I may not be able to make my trip in October. We will have to see. Stay safe.Same here - we were looking at Williamsburg for Halloween again with the obligatory stops in Fredericksburg and Monticello while in the neighborhood. The trip depends greatly upon whether or not we are able to complete a 2 year search and get a motorhome to our liking(no luck so far).Hang loose and roll with the situation - stay well.Hello. I checked the websites of some major hotel chains and they all tout their enhanced cleaning and steps their staff are taking to minimize risks. As the virus will more than likely exist in October I would imagine that those same practices would be in effect then also. I also see people checking into a downtown hotel every afternoon I find myself downtown. October is a great time to visit the 'Burg with very pleasant weather. Hope this helps and enjoy your visit.Hi nursedude - Thank you for your reply and information. Fredericksburg VA seems like an ideal spot to stop on the way between New Jersey and South Carolina / Georgia. It is near I-95 and has a lot to offer. I am reading various TA reviews to identify a hotel. Hopefully the coronavirus situation will be better in October than it is now.We like the Homewood Suites in Fredericksburg but haven't been during COVID. It is clean, food (breakfast daily, dinner with beer and wine M-W or M-Th) is good. Homewood dinners usually include a buffet with salad, an entree, sides and dessert. Right now they are doing limited staff served meals at dinner and grab and go breakfast. I'm sure you know to check travel restrictions before you go. Both SC and GA will trigger a quarantine direction upon your return at this time. Virginia is not looking good, COVID numbers-wise.Hi martijewel - Thank you for your reply. My state New Jersey has a quarantine list which now includes 22 states. If I travel to any state on the list then I will have to quarantine (self-isolate at home) for 14 days once I return to New Jersey. On the way to South Carolina and Georgia I plan to stop in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. How are things now in North Carolina? In view of the coronavirus situation, I will have to decide a few days before my departure date in October. I can cancel all my hotel reservations if necessary at any time before my departure date. Hopefully things will get better.NC is on NJ's quarantine trigger list right now and COVID numbers are surging here so future travel doesn't look good.  We just told our family members from out of state that it is most likely there would be no in person visits here for the rest of the year, at least.I'd try to be hopeful but also make an alternate plan to stick close to home. :(Also, thanks for being mindful and respectful of travel restrictions. We all need to do our part to put this thing down.Hi martijewel - Thank you for the additional information. Things are looking pretty grim right now. I wear a mask, stay six feet or more away from other people, avoid crowds, wash my hands frequently and avoid restaurants (except for take out) and stores (except for supermarkets and our local Barnes and Noble which has good COVID19 safety procedures). The reason why things are so bad is that many people are not doing these things. New Jersey and New York are in good shape after being the worst in the country. So my alternate plan may be just to go to the Jersey shore or even make my first trip in to New York City since early March. But I am going to hope that things will get better and that I will be able to make my trip in October.This is the version of our website addressed to speakers of English in Singapore.

covid19,"RE:PSA: Remote Studies for COVID19 won't ""scar"" your degree nor make you less valuable for jobs",Source: For those stuck doing math at 3am.Forum: r/EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/i2o52n/psa_remote_studies_for_covid19_wont_scar_your/,"Posting this in response to discussions I've been hearing from current STEM students and their parents. Students are concerned that because COVID19 sent everyone home in the middle of last semester, and because the response was rushed with no game plan, that the classes of 2020-2024+ will be viewed as ""less valuable"" because of missed lab experiences, changed grading/test proctoring standards, etc. I want to tell you will be valued the same, if not more, than any of the other engineering graduates when you finish your studies.I finished my studies in Nuclear Engineering from 2014-2019 last December and immediately got a engineering office job, which then sent people home in March of 2020 for COVID19. I had a smooth transition from guided office work to more independent home work for a number of reasons:I had several remote classes in the past which helped me develop independent study skills - knowing how to read textbooks, looking up information from publications in Google Scholar, and creating a study space in my apartment/dorm helped me a lot when working from homeI had to do a ton of collaborative work for my senior level classes - computational projects, group papers, etc. No one had a consistent schedule so we learned to use Google calendar, Google Docs, phone calls/online meetings etc for those that couldn't attend in person.I either lived alone or had respectful roommates in college - A number of the older engineers at my job have pets, children, extended family taking care of the children, etc. that made it difficult for them to focus at work. Compared to older engineers, I had minimal disruptions from my home life.When I was a student many of these lessons learned were optional or coincidental - you guys are getting turbo-charged on these skills as a required adaptability trait and you'll be much better for going through it all.What about the labs I missed? Who would hire a Civil Engineer that doesn't know how to use surveying equipment? Or an Aerospace Engineer that hasn't used the supersonic flow facility?Everyone is in the same boat here - you are not alone here. Your University has a few options here: teach the labs in-person with extreme caution, make you do analytical work on the lab content that is conducted remotely, or replaced with something else completely. You will learn something valuable even if it is not directly from a lab - that responsibility is on your University, not you as a student.As an aside, I will tell you half of the labs I went through in undergrad weren't graded fairly. Students were so swamped with work that the goal of the labs became ""get what I need for the grade"" rather than ""learn from and appreciate the content from this lab"". The labs provide an introduction to tools, equipment, and methods that you may use later in your engineering career but you will always need to revisit theory when you are doing a lab - its not the end of the world if you learn the content later in your job rather than in school. Also, companies will pay you while you learn to use your ""lab"" equipment - a nice change from paying lab fees and higher tuition.I'm good at hands-on engineering work but I suck at programming and theory... am I screwed?Short answer: No, and now is a great time to get better.Long answer: Spend some time reading your textbooks before your lectures (so you know enough to ask questions) and after your lectures (to check your understanding). I had a terrible Thermodynamics professor and I had to teach myself from worked-out examples in my textbook. I went from two 57/100 midterms to a C overall in the semester.Regarding programming and usage of engineering software - this is where you become best friends with Youtube tutorials, and you become best friends with others by learning from (or showing) them on how to program. If you are learning how to program by following instructions step by step and asking questions as needed, you shouldn't need to worry about academic integrity. I've been a TA and the people I have caught cheating will copy and paste code or other work and make identical mistakes as the original because they did not bother to understand how everything worked. Also, contact your TA's - were paid to help you as our jobs.My dream company isn't hiring or doing internships because of COVID19 - what am I supposed to do now?It is rare that your first job (or internship) becomes your final, 40-year career job. Use this opportunity to look for ""fun"" available jobs you wouldn't otherwise consider - gigs at national labs, government agencies, companies focused on the pandemic response, etc. Everyone is going to have a unique story about their time during the COVID19 pandemic, find some way to write a story you will like reading about in the future!My company just had its first ever set of all-remote engineering interns, and they produced fantastic work in record time. You may not appreciate this until you leave school, but engineering students are worked to the bone and have a turbo-productivity drive that most engineers leave behind once hired. This complacency with a slow-paced work environment spreads like the plague to interns that enter the office, and with remote work you aren't nearly as dragged into it - use this to your advantage to blow people's expectations out of the water to prove you don't need to wear uncomfortable clothes and live in a cubicle to produce engineering marvels.I really wanted to study abroad, but now my plans are ruined!Worldly cultural experience is valuable yes, but now is not the time to seek it in person. If you haven't already, this is the time to chat with people internationally online and follow global politics. If you want to practice your language skills with native speakers, contact your study abroad office to see if they can put you in contact with partnered universities that have students wanting to learn English as well. Also, playing video games in foreign languages helps a lot with learning.I was never able to study abroad despite studying two non-English languages, because my program of studies and personal finances did not allow for it. That said, I have traveled throughout the USA for internships, conference presentations, and I will possibly be traveling for work (and paid for it!) once COVID19 passes. Your time to see the world will come, and you will be either teaching others or performing work valued internationally by the time you arrive.How am I supposed to network if everyone if in-person socials are cancelled?For older engineers, in this order: phone calls, online meetings, and email are the best ways to get to know the older engineers. If you are a member of any professional societies (ASME, ANS, APS, IEEE, etc) there are TONS of online seminars, presentations, and conferences going on. Sign up for email notifications and attend these events and ask questions!For fellow engineering students and early-career engineers: this is the future isn't it? Go organize video game sessions and grab a microphone! VRchat, Tabletop Simulator, Halo 3 MCC Custom games, anything you think is fun in groups where you can chat will make long-lasting connections. Introduce your friends and classmates to video games if they weren't into it before. Engineering school made me think playing video games was irresponsible and a waste of my college time; now as an adult its a pandemic-free social outing just like going to bars or bashing your head on a textbook in the library used to be.____________________________________________________Your experience is obviously going to be different than previous graduating classes, but there's already so much variety in content across individual universities and international programs that it won't be as big of a deal as you would think. Take a deep breath (mask on) and realize that things are going to work out in your favor. Engineering is one of the professions that is able to do a ton of work remotely so there will be continued demand for new engineers throughout COVID19.Stay safe ‚úåYou're welcome. I will never forget the anxiety and stress engineering school put me through - I thought you guys could use some positive vibes amidst the world chaosI don't really comment on Reddit but this has really helped change my outlook on this upcoming semester. Thank you for helping me look at ways I can make this situation better, instead of focusing on how it's not what I'd hoped it would be.Roll with the punches :) things will be different and its okay to laugh at the mess COVID19 has created, I'm certain your professors are laughing at it tooMembersOnline"

covid19,Re: Travelodge UK Unfair hotel cancellation rules during COVID19,Source: TripAdvisor ForumsForum: United Kingdom,https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g186216-i15-k13288348-o10-Travelodge_UK_Unfair_hotel_cancellation_rules_during_COVID19-United_Kingdom.html,"Hello everyone, I am writing to get your advice on the issue of hotel cancellations and refunds due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.On 18 April, I was coming to the UK for a short business trip. I booked one night in Travelodge Gatwick hotel, opting for non-refundable Saver Rate. The Travelodge Gatwick Hotel has since closed and I am unable to come to the UK anyway due to COVID 19 travel restrictions.I tried to cancel my booking but Travelodge only offers a voucher (that allows one to book a room in the same hotel at the later time and cannot be redeemed for cash). They refuse to offer a refund. I have no need for that voucher nor will I use it in the future so that means I will have lost the money I paid.Is the hotel's position legal and can it be argued that they are abusing the current situation to recuperate for the lost revenue? After all the hotel is closed on the 18 April so they are no longer offering the lodging. They should be showing compassion and not try to extract the last penny out of people. I think it is not fair!Does anyone have any idea how I can resolve this case and get them to refund me? Is there a consumer protection agency in the UK that can be alerted to these bad practices?Thank you.I agree with PMQ.I‚Äôve already had to cancel 2 trips and probably at ,east another 2. One was an overnight at Gatwick with Premier Inn. I‚Äôd booked a non refundable rates and was expecting to have to add that to my insurance claim or take the hit. Then they said they‚Äôd allow postponements. I still did nothing and never contacted the and said I want to cancel. Then the hotel was closed, they contacted me and I got a full refund back to my credit card.For my big trip I have loads of element and so far have only cancelled 3 out of 8 accomdation bookings because those were refundable,e bookings.for everything else I‚Äôm waiting to see if I can get a voucher for next year or that they will cancel and I might get a refund. Anything where I can‚Äôt get either a voucher or a refund will be an insurance claim.I had a non refundable booking with Premier Inn for the end of April. When it became apparent that I would not be able to fly due to restrictions I asked them about a refund. They were clear that it was not possible but they would allow me to rebook for the same value.I did not cancel and when the hotel closed I received a refund. I will happily rebook with them next year.It sounds like you may have cancelled before they closed. Is that right?Even if the OP cancelled before they closed... the fact remains that the hotel can no longer fulfill the contract.I would do a chargeback. They may try and dispute it, but I don't think they have a leg to stand on.If the OP cancelled before the hotel was closed then it is they, the OP, who doesn't have a leg to stand on.#14 - exactly. The contract ended at the point the OP said ""I want to cancel"" - the fact the hotel closed later is irrelevant.I am also having hassle's with Best Western Mornington Hotel Hyde Park London...Their latest response via Booking.com has 3 condition's:No voucher;Customer to inform Hotel of future date's;Only valid to 31/07/2021COVID19 is on the rise in the UK & unlikely to be under control by well into 2021...My Travel restriction's will not change for UK travel until it is safe to travel.Fortunately at the moment I live in a COVID19 free state,therefore travel to the UK will be a serious risk to my health.I have been in contact with Booking.com & Best Western customer service's,however they disappoint stating Each Hotel has it's own Policy....I had no problem with Jury's Inn,Leonardo Hotel LHR...great service & refund with booking made with similar condition's"

https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/87844

 America's Frontline Doctors aren't the only physicians pushing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ); another expert frequently toeing that line is Harvey Risch, MD, PhD, an epidemiologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.Risch authored a Newsweek editorial on July 23 calling on doctors to immediately start treating patients with HCQ.Risch points readers to his review -- he is the only author -- published in late May in the American Journal of Epidemiology that cites five studies in support of HCQ, particularly when used early in the course of COVID-19.

None are randomized controlled trials. One is the heavily publicized and now discredited French study by Didier Raoult, MD, and colleagues in March that sparked initial hopes for HCQ. Two have no corresponding data or publications.Risch st√∏tter seg alts√• ikke p√• noen egen forskning eller resultater, men p√• andres forskning, blant annet den franske rapporten fra ekspert i smittsomme sykdommer Rauolt, som ogs√• Trump twitret om, men som senere ble diskreditert, blant annet fordi ingen fikk tidslinjene og resultatene til √• stemme.

https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/87844Normally, Raoult demands that ‚ÄúStudies of infectious syndromes should no longer be mined without consistently using negative controls to assess the positive predictive value of a positive result.‚Äù

This he obviously does not apply to himself, especially when the clinical result is already decided in advance.
In his own research, Professor Raoult is no fan of randomised controlled clinical trials. A PubPeer user translated his interview:‚ÄúI have never done randomized trials (‚Ä¶). The effect of randomized stuff, maybe it works on people who had a myocardial infarction, but putting that in infectious diseases, it doesn‚Äôt make sense‚Äù

As Elisabeth Bik discussed, the paper was peer-reviewed in less than 24h, it probably helped that the journal‚Äôs Editor-in-Chief is both the paper‚Äôs coauthor and Raoult‚Äôs IHU subordinate Jean-Marc Rolain. Bik also listed other problems with that paper. Like this:‚ÄúIn the EU Clinical Trial Register page, the study was described as evaluating PCR data on Day 1, Day 4, Day 7 and Day 14. However, the study show the data for Day 6, which is different than planned. Why did the authors not show the results on Day 7? Did the data on day 7 not look as good?‚Äù

In fact, the authors never showed the results of day 14 either. They also refused to share their secondary endpoint data, namely ‚Äúthe clinical effectiveness of treatment on time to apyrexia, normalization of respiratory rate, and average length of hospital stay and mortality‚Äù. Basically, it is none of anyone‚Äôs business to know if the therapy had any clinical benefit for the patients.Det er verdt √• lese hele den artikkelen, at en anerkjent professor kan komme med slikt v√•s, er rett og slett oppsiktsvekkende, artikkelen har en setning som oppsummerer det hele ganske bra.

""It is the opposite of proper clinical research practice"" !Fra VGI √•tte √•r har norske Monica Jakobsen bodd i et lite tettsted i grensekommunen Eda i Sverige.
...
Monica forteller at hun opplever at lokalsamfunnet er sv√¶rt opptatt av √• f√∏lge smittevernr√•dene. Men da hun dro for √• handle p√• Charlottenberg-senteret forrige l√∏rdag, samme dag som norske myndigheter √•pnet for reiser til og fra V√§rmland uten karantene, snudde hun n√¶rmest i d√∏ren.‚Äì Det var et mareritt. Det var som en hel h√∏nseflokk hadde g√•tt amok p√• senteret, sier hun.https://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/i/P9kqvX/norske-monica-i-varmland-frykter-oekt-smitte-etter-grenseaapning

Hun er alts√• opptatt av smittevern, men valgte √• dra p√• et av nordens st√∏rste kj√∏pesenter p√• en l√∏rdag, samme dag som grensen ble √•pnet for nordmenn, trolig den verste dagen p√• flere ti√•r √• handle p√•.

Hun holdt p√• √• snu i d√∏ren, men hun gjorde det ikke, neida, hun gikk inn √• handlet likevel.

Jeg ville kanskje tenkt meg om to ganger f√∏r jeg tok den historien til pressen, de fleste som var opptatt av smittevern hadde vel faktisk snudd i d√∏ren, √• kommet tilbake 09:00 p√• s√∏ndag morgen, n√•r det trolig ikke var noe s√¶rlig folk der?Ja, jeg veit ikke, men...""I am referring, of course, to the medication hydroxychloroquine.

 America's Frontline Doctors aren't the only physicians pushing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ); another expert frequently toeing that line is Harvey Risch, MD, PhD, an epidemiologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.Risch authored a Newsweek editorial on July 23 calling on doctors to immediately start treating patients with HCQ.Risch points readers to his review -- he is the only author -- published in late May in the American Journal of Epidemiology that cites five studies in support of HCQ, particularly when used early in the course of COVID-19.

None are randomized controlled trials. One is the heavily publicized and now discredited French study by Didier Raoult, MD, and colleagues in March that sparked initial hopes for HCQ. Two have no corresponding data or publications.Risch st√∏tter seg alts√• ikke p√• noen egen forskning eller resultater, men p√• andres forskning, blant annet den franske rapporten fra ekspert i smittsomme sykdommer Rauolt, som ogs√• Trump twitret om, men som senere ble diskreditert, blant annet fordi ingen fikk tidslinjene og resultatene til √• stemme.

https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/87844Normally, Raoult demands that ‚ÄúStudies of infectious syndromes should no longer be mined without consistently using negative controls to assess the positive predictive value of a positive result.‚Äù

This he obviously does not apply to himself, especially when the clinical result is already decided in advance.
In his own research, Professor Raoult is no fan of randomised controlled clinical trials. A PubPeer user translated his interview:‚ÄúI have never done randomized trials (‚Ä¶). The effect of randomized stuff, maybe it works on people who had a myocardial infarction, but putting that in infectious diseases, it doesn‚Äôt make sense‚Äù

As Elisabeth Bik discussed, the paper was peer-reviewed in less than 24h, it probably helped that the journal‚Äôs Editor-in-Chief is both the paper‚Äôs coauthor and Raoult‚Äôs IHU subordinate Jean-Marc Rolain. Bik also listed other problems with that paper. Like this:‚ÄúIn the EU Clinical Trial Register page, the study was described as evaluating PCR data on Day 1, Day 4, Day 7 and Day 14. However, the study show the data for Day 6, which is different than planned. Why did the authors not show the results on Day 7? Did the data on day 7 not look as good?‚Äù

In fact, the authors never showed the results of day 14 either. They also refused to share their secondary endpoint data, namely ‚Äúthe clinical effectiveness of treatment on time to apyrexia, normalization of respiratory rate, and average length of hospital stay and mortality‚Äù. Basically, it is none of anyone‚Äôs business to know if the therapy had any clinical benefit for the patients.Det er verdt √• leseVi kan diskutere dette hele kvelden, hva som er riktig og sant.

Kan man leve med den skammen?    Javisst, Risch er en av de som helt siden starten har promotert klorokin, noe han fortsetter √• gj√∏re.

Han trenger nok ikke frykte for jobben, hans sjef ved Yale har allerede v√¶rt ute √• distansert universet fra Risch, men samtidig p√•pekt at deres ansatte st√•r fritt til √• ha sine egne meninger, uten av Yale vil sl√• ned p√•, eller nekte ansatte √• uttale seg osv.

https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/87844Det er verdt √• lese hele den artikkelen, at en anerkjent professor kan komme med slikt v√•s, er rett og slett oppsiktsvekkende, artikkelen har en setning som oppsummerer det hele ganske bra.

I believe Covid19 is real and dangerous. However some people close to me that are nurses/doctors/scientists have said otherwise. I came here to hear the arguments from those who say Covid19 is fake because I am interested in what evidence can be shown.So, I've been hearing from people that Covid19 is a hoax. The majority of people in my life say it is real and social distancing and masks are necessary. However, there are a few that say that it is not real. Some of these people are even doctors/nurses. I want to acknowledge that there are intelligent people from both sides of the argument. I have seen data on why it is real/dangerous, but not as much as to why it is fake/no dangerous. I want to understand the facts as to why Covid19 is seen as a hoax to some.‚ÄúIntelligent people from both sides of the argument‚Äù no one who thinks it‚Äôs a hoax is intelligent, sorry.MembersOnline"
