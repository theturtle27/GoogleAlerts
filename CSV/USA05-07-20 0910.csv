The state of Florida set a new record for coronavirus infections; more than 11,000 in a single day.President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump celebrated 4th July by posting a video of a cowboy riding a bucking horse on Twitter... with the caption, ""Happy 4th of July! God Bless the U.S.A!"" Florida's confirmed coronavirus cases rose by a record 11,458 on Saturday, the state's health department said, the second time in three days that its caseload increased by more than 10,000. In just the first four days of July, 14 states have posted a daily record increase in cases of Covid-19.The recent surge, most pronounced in southern and western states, has alarmed public health officials, who urged caution ahead of the holiday weekend to celebrate the Declaration of Independence of the United States in 1776. Florida's record rise in cases was more than any European country's daily peak at the height of the outbreak there.North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alaska, Missouri, Idaho and Alabama all registered new daily highs on Friday, while Texas hit a new peak for hospitalizations. The daily U.S. tally of cases stood at 53,483 late on Friday, below the previous day's record 55,405. Despite the jump in infections, the average daily death toll in the United States has gradually declined in recent weeks, a reflection of the growing proportion of positive tests among younger, healthier people who are less prone to severe outcomes.

Texas, Florida, Arizona and California have seen a resurgence in new cases and record numbers of hospitalisations reaffirming fears that a second wave is a very real possibility..0

USA,US officers fired over photos imitating chokehold on Black man,Aljazeera.com,https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&sa=t&url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/07/officers-fired-photos-imitating-chokehold-black-man-200704112639183.html&ct=ga&cd=CAAYAzIdYzdhYjFmODVkNmQ0NWMzNDpjb20uc2c6ZW46U0c&usg=AFQjCNEIRu6idQnOQyy0qMpYOb6SQ3kX4Q,"Colorado officers Erica Marrero, Kyle Dittrich and Jaron Jones mocked chokehold used to subdue Elijah McClain last year.Three police officers have been fired over photos showing them re-enact a chokehold used on Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man who died last year after police stopped him on the street in a Denver suburb.Officers Erica Marrero, Kyle Dittrich and Jaron Jones had imitated the chokehold used to subdue McClain in October last year.In a statement posted online, interim police chief of Aurora Vanessa Wilson confirmed on Friday that Marrero and Dittrich had been fired. The third officer, Jones, resigned on Tuesday, she said.She added that she understood ""the devastating impact this incident has had on the relationship between the community and the [police] department"".A fourth officer, Jason Rosenblatt, was also fired on Friday, she said. He was sent the photo by one of the three and had responded with a text saying ""haha"", local US media reported.Rosenblatt, a white Aurora officer, had helped stop McClain in August last year for wearing a ski mask and ""being suspicious"". After police put McClain in a chokehold, paramedics injected him with a sedative and he later suffered cardiac arrest.Officer Nathan Woodyard, who put McClain in the chokehold, also got the photos but he was not disciplined because he did not respond.""We are ashamed, we are sickened, and we are angry,"" Wilson said. The officers may not have committed a crime, but the photographs are ""a crime against humanity and decency"", she said.McClain's death had become a rallying cry amid a national reckoning over police brutality and racial injustice, with the state reopening the case for possible criminal charges and federal officials looking into a civil rights investigation.In several places, the chokehold has been banned and other police reforms passed after nationwide protests.McClain's family, friends and community activists noted during a rally that justice was swifter for the mocking photograph than the use of force that led to McClain's death.The two other officers who stopped the young man are still on the force as authorities look again into possible criminal charges after clearing them last year. ""Rosenblatt got fired not for killing Elijah, not for murdering Elijah, but for making fun of Elijah,"" said Terrence Roberts, a community organiser and family friend.""That is the culture that we're fighting, where a police officer can murder a Black man, a Black child, and keep his job and stay on the force so he can go make fun of this child.Several police agencies have taken swift action to punish officers, including those involved in George Floyd's death on May 25 in Minneapolis that ushered in global demonstrations. For Elijah McClain's mother, Sheneen McClain, ""it was just devastating to see that people were mocking the murder of her son"", family lawyer Mari Newman said.""The fact that three on-duty, in-uniform police officers thought that it was appropriate to re-enact the murder, jokingly, shows that the department is rotten to the core,"" she said.Facing increasing pressure as celebrities and others on social media called for justice, Colorado Governor Jared Polis last week ordered the state attorney general to reopen McClain's case.The officers stopped McClain, a massage therapist, after a 911 call on August 24 reported him as suspicious because he was wearing a ski mask and flailing his arms. He begged them repeatedly to let go of him, according to body-camera video.After the chokehold that cut off blood to his brain, paramedics administered 500 milligrams of a sedative to calm him down. A forensic pathologist could not determine what exactly led to McClain's death but said physical exertion during the confrontation likely contributed.Police body-camera video shows an officer getting out of his car, approaching McClain and saying, ""Stop right there. Stop. Stop ... I have a right to stop you because you're being suspicious.""In the video, the officer turns McClain around and repeats, ""Stop tensing up!"" As McClain tries to escape the grip, the officer says, ""Relax or I'm going to have to change this situation.""As other officers join to restrain McClain, he begs them to let go and says, ""You guys started to arrest me, and I was stopping my music to listen.""Aurora police have said McClain refused to stop walking and fought back when officers tried to take him into custody.In the video, McClain tells officers: ""Let go of me. I am an introvert. Please respect the boundaries that I am speaking.""The US attorney's office, the US Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the FBI announced this week they are looking into whether to launch a civil rights investigation. Federal authorities said they were also considering an investigation into the photos.SOURCE: NEWS AGENCIESAdvertisement© 2020 Al Jazeera Media Network "
USA,Coronavirus updates: Some Florida beaches open despite record daily case count; fireworks ...,USA TODAY,https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&sa=t&url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/07/04/covid-updates-beaches-closed-fireworks-canceled-fourth-july/5374185002/&ct=ga&cd=CAAYBDIdYzdhYjFmODVkNmQ0NWMzNDpjb20uc2c6ZW46U0c&usg=AFQjCNE6gruiZuYCJcQyUL44nrufHVmomA,"Thanks to rising coronavirus infections in the U.S.,most Americans' Fourth of July celebrations this year won't include a community fireworks display, a trip to a crowded beach or a big backyard barbecue — or at least that's what many health officials are hoping. It's a starkly different situation from the nation's last major holiday. Over Memorial Day, the U.S. was emerging from a months-long lockdown with states rapidly rolling back business closures and social distancing regulations. Coronavirus case counts showed promising trends and calls to reopen the economy had grown fierce.But it's a different story heading this Fourth of July. A national spike in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks has led nearly half of U.S. states to take new steps to limit the spread of the virus, with many making special rules to combat crowds over the holiday weekend. That comes as the infection curve is rising in about 40 states.As cases surge in Florida, California and Texas, some beaches are closing in an effort to discourage large crowds over the holiday. But backyard gatherings — an iconic staple of the Fourth of July holiday — are perhaps even more concerning to public health officials.Here are some recent developments:📈Today's stats: The U.S. recorded 52,104 new cases of the coronavirus Friday, the third day in the row that daily cases surpassed 50,000, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. has seen more than 2.8 million confirmed cases and more than 129,000 deaths. Globally, there have been more than 11.1 million cases and more than 527,000 deaths.📰 What we're reading: The CDC is calling on Americans to remain vigilant this Fourth of July by social distancing and wearing face masks. So we've compiled these tips for creating a special Fourth of July while following guidelines to slow the spread of COVID-19.Our live blog will be updated throughout the day. For first-in-the-morning updates, sign up for The Daily Briefing.Governors and health officials are urging Americans to wear face masks and social distance, but while some fireworks shows and events were canceled, there are still many still happening across the U.S. Here's a look:Amid thousands of protests against police brutality and a pandemic that has disproportionately ravaged communities of color, many people planned to spend Fourth of July drawing attention to what they say is a hypocritical celebration of freedom.Rallies, marches and sit-ins were planned Saturday in Chicago, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and more than a dozen other U.S. cities.Organizers said they planned to ask everyone to social distance, wear masks and use hand sanitizer to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Medical personnel would also be handing out face masks.""Of course, you're always going to be scared, but it's for the movement for Black liberation. You have to risk (for) that,"" said D.C.-based organizer Kerrigan William, who said she is immunocompromised.– Grace HauckFlorida reported 11,458 new cases of the coronavirus Saturday, setting a record for most new cases in one day. It is the eleventh straight day that the state counted at least 5,000 new cases, according to data from the Florida Department of Health.While many beaches are closed, there are some open on South Florida's east coast. By noon Friday, beach access parking lots in Indian River County had started to fill and families had staked-their claims on the sand with umbrellas, tents and canopies.In Vero Beach, officials are only allowing beach access to city and county residents and are checking people's identification. The total number of COVID-19 cases statewide is now 190,052. The state has more than tripled the total number of cases since its Phase 2 reopening began June 5. Bars were closed for the second time during the pandemic June 26 to try to limit the spread of the virus.— Rachael Thomas and Corey Arwood, Treasure Coast NewspapersDespite objections from health officials, President Donald Trump is hosting hundreds of people for a Fourth of July party at the White House that will feature music and fireworks. This year's event is somewhat scaled back – there won't be armored military vehicles on display at the Lincoln Memorial, as happened last year.The fight against the coronavirus pandemic is even a theme of what the White House calls a ""Salute to America."" Invited guests include doctors, nurses, and other front-line responders to the COVID-19 crisis, as well as members of the military, law enforcement and their families.Given the recent spikes in COVID-19 cases, the White House said it will provide face masks and hand sanitizer to guests, and encourage social distancing. Some guests will be on the Ellipse just south of the White House.Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser, who canceled the traditional Fourth of July parade in the nation's capital, said her office informed Trump's Interior Department that the event it is planning violates the health guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Thousands of people are expected to gather up and down the National Mall to watch fireworks.– David JacksonOne day after President Donald Trump spoke to a largely maskless audience at a Fourth of July celebration at Mount Rushmore, former Vice President Joe Biden declared face-covering during the COVID-19 pandemic an expression of patriotism. ""This Fourth of July, one of the most patriotic things you can do is wear a mask,"" he tweeted Saturday.Arizona reported 2,695 new COVID-19 cases and 17 additional deaths on Saturday, according to data from the Arizona Department of Health Services.The number of people in the hospitals and using ICU beds again broke records Friday. Saturday's dashboard shows 85% of current inpatient beds and 90% of ICU beds were in use, which includes people being treated for COVID-19 and other patients.Arizona is among the worst hot spots in the nation for COVID-19. The disease is widespread here, and health officials caution people to stay home as much as possible and wear masks in public.Vice President Mike Pence, who visited Arizona on Wednesday, said he is deploying hundreds of medical personnel to assist the state.– BrieAnna J. Frank, Arizona RepublicCostco is the largest retailer staying closed on Independence Day, which it traditionally does for other holidays too, including New Year's Day, Easter, Memorial Day and Labor Day. This year, Trader Joe's is closed, a change from past years when it operated with reduced hours, ""to give all of our Crew Members a much needed and well-deserved day of rest,"" the grocer said on its website.Read the full list of retailers, grocery stores and restaurants.— Kelly TykoHouston's fire chief says 307 firefighters — a record — are in quarantine because of exposure to COVID-10 and their absence is putting an ""extreme strain"" on the department. Houston is among the hardest hit cities in Texas, which is reeling from new cases of the virus.""We will respond when called, but I also encourage citizens to help us by following health and safety protocols during the current public health crisis,"" Chief Sam Pena said in a statement  Friday. ""Please wear a mask, physical distance and wash your hands. Do not use fireworks during the July 4th holiday weekend because they can cause fires and create an additional strain on our resources.""Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner authorized additional overtime pay for firefighters.Patrick Lancton, president of the Houston Professional Firefighters Association, said some firefighters have been working for two and three days straight. He said they will continue to answer calls but warned that the fire department is ""at a breaking point, and has been for a long time.""— Doug StanglinA Trump 2020 campaign official and the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., tested positive for the coronavirus ahead of the president's celebration event at Mount Rushmore on Friday.Kimberly Guilfoyle and Trump Jr., who tested negative on Friday, will cancel their upcoming events and will self-isolate, according to Sergio Gor, chief of staff to Trump Victory Finance committee.""She’s doing well, and will be retested to ensure the diagnosis is correct since she’s asymptomatic,"" Gor said in a statement. ""But as a precaution will cancel all upcoming events. Donald Trump Jr. was tested negative, but as a precaution is also self isolating and is canceling all public events.""Guilfoyle traveled to South Dakota with Trump Jr., but not aboard Air Force One with the president, according to The New York Times and ABC News.– Jeanine SantucciTribal police for the Navajo Nation and the New Mexico National Guard plan to enforce a curfew to shut down the Navajo reservation during the Fourth of July weekend.The sprawling reservation has been trying to contain a coronavirus outbreak. Tribal President Jonathan Nez says the curfew will run until 5 a.m. Monday. He says it is the first of three consecutive weekend lockdowns.Nez warns that enforcement on the reservation that spans parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah will be strict.The tribe reported 64 new confirmed coronavirus cases Friday and two more deaths.— Associated PressMajor League Baseball, resuming spring training Friday, announced that 31 players and seven staff members tested positive for COVID-19 as part of intake screening. The 38 positives were 1.2% of the 3,185 total samples collected and tested, according to the league.Teams are not permitted to identify the players who tested positive for COVID-19, but two players, Delino DeShields Jr. of the Cleveland Indians and Brett Martin of the Texas Rangers each revealed their positive tests. Any player who tests positive for COVID-19 must test negative twice at least 24 hours apart from one another, with no fever for 72 hours, before he can rejoin a team.Atlanta Braves All-Star first baseman Freddie Freeman and three other players are out indefinitely after testing positive.— Bob NightengaleWhere a face mask is required: Many governors are instituting or renewing orders requiring people to wear face coverings in public as cases continue to rise.
