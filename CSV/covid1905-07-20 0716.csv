covid19,Why Some Young People Fear Social Isolation More Than COVID-19,NPR,https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&sa=t&url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/07/04/885546281/why-some-young-people-fear-social-isolation-more-than-covid-19&ct=ga&cd=CAAYADIdZmQyNzJjNDk4NjUwYWNmYzpjb20uc2c6ZW46U0c&usg=AFQjCNEQDUJ5af7sX7Q9TYfN07VMWw63YA,"YUKI NOGUCHIRecent protests in Philadelphia and across the country have drawn young people. But for most of the pandemic, youth have been quarantined and away from their social circles, which could make depression and other mental illness worse.Audrey just turned 18 and relishes crossing into adulthood: She voted for the first time this year, graduated high school and is college-bound next month. The honors student typically wakes up ""a bundle of nerves,"" she says, which had fueled her work volunteering, playing varsity sports and leading student government.But for years, she also struggled with anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder — all of which drove her to work harder.""I was spending so much time on my homework, I felt like I was losing my friends — so my thoughts would race over and over again about my friends,"" says Audrey. ""And then I would have the difficult thoughts about suicide and some scarier stuff."" (NPR agreed to use only her first name to protect her medical privacy.)Audrey's psychological struggles landed her in mental health treatment last fall. There, she says, the coping skills she learned gave her perspective on quarantine: ""I know all about how seeing friends and seeing people outside — and social interaction — is vital for survival.""There is a simmering tension between young people's desire to gather socially, and the growing threat from the coronavirus in the United States. The virus is now infecting more people in their teens and 20s than it had earlier in the pandemic, and that's contributing to outbreaks, especially in states in the South and West. As a result, public health officials are imploring young adults to limit social contact and take precautions to help protect their more vulnerable elders. But many young people see continued social isolation as a much greater risk than COVID-19 to their own mental health.It's not that Audrey isn't worried about the pandemic; in fact, confirmed cases of the coronavirus are spiking in her hometown of Charlotte, N.C. So Audrey wears masks, washes her hands and stays 6 feet from friends. But for her generation, she says, infection isn't the primary threat.""A lot of people are calling attention to coronavirus because it's right in front of us,"" she says. ""But at the same time, teens' depression rate — it's a silent threat.""The health risks of infection differ by generation. For many young adults, life lived at a social distance, with a lack of peer support, comes at a high cost to mental health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says nearly half of people between 18 and 29 report feeling symptoms of anxiety or depression. That's significantly higher that the rate for both their parents and their grandparents. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for people under 35.Yet somehow, says Audrey, that's not talked about as much.""We haven't seen the government or adults as passionate about the things we really care about, like mental health and climate issues,"" she says.It might be tempting to think that FaceTime and Zoom provide substitutes for in-person social outlets, especially for a generation of digital natives who grew up with smartphones. But, therapists say, talking by small screen offers no replacement for a calming hug and can miss the subtleties of a compassionate expression.Audrey's complaint is a common refrain among the adolescent and young adult patients whom psychologist Lisa Jacobs counsels. It is not that they aren't concerned about the risks of COVID-19, she says; it's just that their risk calculations differ.""They are appropriately realizing that isolation is a risk for them as well — it's a risk factor for depression, and depression is a risk factor for suicide,"" Jacobs says. ""And 8% of American teens attempt suicide each year.""Jacobs says many of her young patients complain older generations failed to address the young people's fears — of school shootings and climate change, for example.""After not being protected, after not being taken seriously, they were asked to take extreme measures to protect other groups and to put themselves at risk by doing so,"" Jacobs says.There is a biological basis for young people's need for socialization. Scientists say bonding isn't a luxury; it's critical for development.Young brains need social connection to feel secure about their identity and place in the world, says Gregory Lewis, who studies the neurobiology of social interaction at Indiana University.If You Need Help: ResourcesIf you or someone you know is in crisis, help is available. Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255, or go here to chat online.For more help:""We expect as a human being to have other people there to share the stressful times and to be our backup, and when they're not there physically, that in of itself tells our nervous system 'you're in a dangerous environment because you don't have these people here,' "" he says.That is less of an issue among older adults, Lewis says, who have had more time to develop their social networks — both at work and around their community — and more time to find partners who can help ground them emotionally. By contrast, he says, ""younger people are missing a larger percentage of what previously was there to buffer them.""So the societal challenge, he says, is to find ways to help community members of all ages balance the risks of infection against the need to foster those essential social bonds.NPR thanks our sponsorsBecome an NPR sponsor"
covid19,Covid-19 is here to stay. People will have to adapt,The Economist,https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&sa=t&url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/07/04/covid-19-is-here-to-stay-people-will-have-to-adapt&ct=ga&cd=CAAYATIdZmQyNzJjNDk4NjUwYWNmYzpjb20uc2c6ZW46U0c&usg=AFQjCNEBhzYKM2_eTI2WSkmlWKn2XEZukw,"The world is not experiencing a second wave: it never got over the firstEditor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of The Economist Today, our daily newsletter. For more stories and our pandemic tracker, see our hubI
t is astonishing how rapidly the pandemic has spread, despite all the efforts to stop it. On February 1st, the day covid-19 first appeared on our front cover, the World Health Organisation counted 2,115 new cases. On June 28th its daily tally reached 190,000. That day as many new cases were notched up every 90 minutes as had been recorded in total by February 1st.The world is not experiencing a second wave: it never got over the first. Some 10m people are known to have been infected. Pretty much everywhere has registered cases (Turkmenistan and North Korea have not, though, like Antarctica). For every country such as China, Taiwan and Vietnam, which seems to be able to contain the virus, there are more, in Latin America and South Asia, where it is raging. Others, including the United States, are at risk of losing control or, in much of Africa, in the early phase of their epidemic. Europe is somewhere in between.The worst is to come. Based on research in 84 countries, a team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reckons that, for each recorded case, 12 go unrecorded and that for every two covid-19 deaths counted, a third is misattributed to other causes. Without a medical breakthrough, it says, the total number of cases will climb to 200m-600m by spring 2021. At that point, between 1.4m and 3.7m people will have died. Even then, well over 90% of the world’s population will still be vulnerable to infection—more if immunity turns out to be transient.The actual outcome depends on how societies manage the disease. Here the news is better. Epidemiologists understand how to stop covid-19. You catch it indoors, in crowds, when people raise their voices. The poor are vulnerable, as are the elderly and those with other conditions. You can contain the virus with three tactics: changes in behaviour; testing, tracing and isolation; and, if they fail, lockdowns. The worse a country is at testing—and many governments have failed to build enough capacity—the more it has to fall back on the other two. Good public health need not be expensive. Dharavi, a slum of 850,000 people in Mumbai, tamed an outbreak (see article).Treatments have improved, thanks to research and dealing with patients. Although mass vaccination is still months away at best (see article), the first therapies are available. More is known about how to manage the disease—don’t rush to put people on respirators, do give them oxygen early. Better treatment helps explain why the share of hospital patients who went on to be admitted to intensive care fell in Britain from 12% at the end of March to 4% in mid to late May."

Texas hit a new peak for hospitalisations, with one doctor calling for a ""complete lockdown"" in the state to get the virus under control.The daily US tally of cases stood at 53,483 late on Friday, below the previous day's record 55,405.The recent surge, most pronounced in southern and western states, has alarmed public health officials, who urged caution ahead of a Jul 4 holiday weekend to celebrate the Declaration of Independence of the United States in 1776.North Carolina reported 951 hospitalisations and 2,099 cases, both record highs.Bill Saffo, mayor of Wilmington, North Carolina, said many infections had been traced to large gatherings and predicted a further jump after the holiday weekend as people flouted guidelines on social distancing and masks.""We know that the spread is going to happen. We know probably in about two weeks we'll see a spike from the Jul 4 weekend,"" Saffo told CNN.Despite the jump in infections, the daily death rate in the United States has remained relatively flat, a reflection of the growing proportion of positive tests among younger, healthier people who are less prone to severe outcomes.However, US Surgeon General Jerome Adams warned that the impact on fatalities from the recent surge, which started in mid-June, had yet to be seen. ""Deaths lag at least two weeks and can lag even more,"" he told Fox & Friends on Friday.His remarks came hours ahead of a trip by President Donald Trump to Mount Rushmore in South Dakota, where he is expected to give a speech to thousands of supporters in which he will rail against the ""left wing mob"" and view a fireworks display at the landmark depicting four US presidents in stone.The visit has drawn criticism from Native Americans, who say the remote area is sacred to them, as well as health experts who discourage large congregations of people.Trump, whose handling of the pandemic has come under harsh criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, has repeatedly sought to dismiss the jump in cases as a function of more tests and again this week predicted the virus would ""disappear"".MORE MASKSCoronavirus cases are rising in 37 of the 50 US states including Florida, which had 9,488 new cases on Friday, according to the state health department. Florida's 10,109 cases on Thursday was a record for the state and more than any European country's daily peak at the height of the outbreak there.Evidence that the surge is not simply due to expanded testing, the percentage of tests coming back positive in Florida has hit 16 per cent, up from 4 per cent a month ago, according to a Reuters analysis. The World Health Organization says a rate over 5 per cent is concerning.Against that backdrop, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez imposed an indefinite nightly curfew starting on Friday and halted the reopenings of entertainment venues such as casinos and strip clubs. Earlier this week, Miami-Dade and neighbouring Broward County, the state's two most populous counties, required residents to wear face coverings in public.Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson on Friday authorised the state's cities and towns to enact a ""model ordinance"" requiring the wearing of face coverings if they choose to do so, becoming the latest Republican to relent to pressure on the issue.The move came a day after Texas Governor Greg Abbott ordered that face masks be worn in most public places, reversing his stance following an alarming rise in infections in the state, which on Friday marked a new high for hospitalisations at 7,652.Owais Durrani, a resident at University Hospital in San Antonio, said nearly all the patients coming into the emergency room tested positive for COVID-19 – even those admitted for unrelated issues such as gall bladder infections.""We, in my opinion, need to go into a complete lockdown and we're still going to see an increase in all of those metrics for two to three weeks and then maybe we turn a corner,"" he said.Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright© Mediacorp 2020.

covid19,If you are infected: demystifying Covid-19 care,The Indian Express,https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&sa=t&url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/if-you-are-infected-demystifying-covid-19-care-6485803/&ct=ga&cd=CAAYAzIdZmQyNzJjNDk4NjUwYWNmYzpjb20uc2c6ZW46U0c&usg=AFQjCNG627f0kC21K7KgJFDRbjOrkLmTmw,"Written by Dr Satchit Balsari, Dr Zarir UdwadiaAfter three months of missteps, there seems to be consensus — or rather a late realisation — that not all patients with Covid-19 need to be taken to hospitals. We have known with fair certainty since early March that Covid-19 does not spread like Ebola, and that in the absence of effective medical treatment, non-pharmaceutical interventions like hand-washing, masking and physical distancing would be the best defence. And yet, for nearly one hundred days, confirmed cases of Covid-19 in India’s cities were being admitted to hospitals, irrespective of the severity of disease.This blunder — with no clinical justification — resulted in first paralysing, then overwhelming, and finally crushing entire health systems. The hospitals were rendered incapable of caring for tens of thousands of other patients with non-Covid-related diseases, and jeopardised the wellbeing of their overworked staff. What can other cities, towns and villages in India learn from this, as the pandemic spreads to the hinterland?Explained | The G4 flu virus with ‘pandemic potential’, found by Chinese researchers?There are a finite number of permutations that can occur, when someone is exposed to Covid-19. Let’s walk through these possibilities, and the possible care pathways each situation warrants.Asymptomatics: If exposed, one gets Covid-19 or one doesn’t. Of all who get it, most will be asymptomatic: they will show no symptoms, but will continue to spread it. It is likely that they may be less contagious than someone who is actively coughing, but there is no evidence to suggest that the asymptomatic patients do not spread the virus. They, however, need no treatment.Presymptomatics and mild cases: Of the few that are symptomatic, all will first be pre-symptomatic. This is the roughly two-day interval in which they will be contagious, will spread the virus, but will not have developed symptoms. Eventually they will develop one or a combination of the Covid-19 symptoms we recognise: loss of smell or taste, cough, fever, and so on.Most of these symptomatic cases will only have mild symptoms and will also need no treatment, except what physicians appropriately call “symptomatic management”, with medications to simply manage the fever and cough and bodyaches. Home remedies may help with some of this, but there is no evidence that they alter the course of the disease.Symptomatics, moderate: Of the remainder, some will develop moderate symptoms, and some will develop severe disease. Only these two categories need sophisticated medical intervention.Explained | What is Covaxin, India’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate?Those with moderate symptoms will benefit from oxygen therapy, and “pronation,” which in plain English, means lying on your belly, instead of your back. Doing so opens up the air chambers in the back of your lungs that are normally collapsed, thereby providing more oxygen to your blood. Early evidence shows that this helps avert the need for more aggressive intervention in some cases.But the principal intervention for those with moderate severity is oxygen — which can be delivered through a mask and tube connected to a portable oxygen tank (which like a gas cylinder, is heavy, and must be replaced); or as piped oxygen, as is available in some hospitals, and which comes from larger tanks; or simply via a small, portable machine called an oxygen concentrator which makes oxygen from air. Many people with lung diseases have them at home. There is no clinical justification to take up ICU beds for these patients. They do not need ventilators, or intensive care specialists — especially when no city in India has enough of either, and most smaller towns and villages have neither.Severe cases: Unlike run-of-the-mill pneumonias, we have observed that the shortness of breath in patients with Covid-19 can progress abruptly, and these patients need ventilators. These breathing machines are highly complex systems that need skilled technicians to run them, and require that patients have a flexible plastic tube advanced into their trachea (windpipe), typically by an anaesthesiologist or emergency physicians or intensivists. The patients then have to be kept sedated (asleep) with a precisely dosed intravenous medication — an overdose of which can easily kill the patient. And finally, plasma donated from Covid-19 survivors helps some of the sickest. These are the critical elements of an “ICU bed” — there is nothing special about the bed itself.📣 Express Explained is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@ieexplained) and stay updated with the latestCommunity-based care: The best way to relax the load on hospitals is to keep all those who do not need hospital-based care, away from hospitals — for as long as is safely possible. Keeping people home safely means monitoring symptomatic patients by measuring their respiratory rate (counting how many breaths they take per minute — the average person takes about 12) and their oxygen saturation, using a small device that clips on to your fingertips, called pulse-oximeter. Neighbourhood champions and community health workers can be easily taught to do this via online teaching aids.If the oxygen saturation begins to go down, or the respiratory rate begins to go up, the patients need intervention — first, oxygen therapy. Most will not have access to hospitals, and can be safely given oxygen at home when possible, or in neighbourhood Covid-care centres. A minority will have to go to hospital.There will, of course, be many exceptions to this neat linear progression, but the vast majority will follow this trajectory, as data from around the world are showing. (We still don’t have reliable clinical data from India.)This strategy is not new. By early April, patients in New York, where the epidemic was then at its peak, were being sent home with pulse-oximeters and even oxygen concentrators. Various states in India were at the time embracing unproven, unvalidated interventions.Don’t miss from Explained | Bad June, two lakh cases in last 12 daysInstead of distributing spice mixtures, arsenicum album and hydroxychloroquine, it will now be wiser to distribute pulse-oximeters to communities at risk. So far, early data suggest that a steroid and the antiviral remdesivir may show some benefit in more severe hospitalised cases. Favipiravir has been approved for use in moderate cases in India, but the data have not been released. Note however, that a similar wonder-drug for influenza mostly brings down symptoms by a day. These medications are not cures.Covid-19 will ravage neighbourhoods across India. The best strategy will be to mount a hyper-local response that is backed by science. Dharavi and Kerala — very different from each other — have shown how a highly context-driven strategy works. Most of those who will get Covid-19 will be fine. Among those who have some symptoms, monitor as many as possible with pulse-oximeters (or simply by counting the respiratory rate, when devices run out). And if short of breath, administer oxygenation and pronation.A minority will get very sick, and will require critical care. The harsh reality is that most from the last group will not get the care they need. We cannot fix decades of neglect while in the throes of a pandemic.(Dr Satchit Balsari is assistant professor in Emergency Medicine and in Global Health at Harvard University’s medical and public health schools.

Four of the nine community cases were Singaporeans, three were work pass holders, and two were work permit holders.COMMUNITY CASESOf the nine community cases, one is linked to a previous case, while eight are currently unlinked.Of the eight unlinked cases, one is an 82-year-old Singaporean woman, whose onset of symptoms began on Jul 1. She was confirmed to have COVID-19 on Saturday.The only linked case is a 38-year-old Bangladeshi national, who is a contact of previous case. He had already been quarantined earlier. He was asymptomatic and was tested during quarantine to verify his status, MOH said.Of the eight unlinked cases, three were ""proactively swabbed"" as they work in essential services, even though two were asymptomatic. Another unlinked case was detected as part of MOH's ""proactive"" screening of individuals deployed to frontline COVID-19 operations.Epidemiological investigations are ongoing for the remaining four cases. Of those four cases, three were tested under the ministry's enhanced community testing after being diagnosed with acute respiratory infection.The number of new cases in the community has increased, from an average of six per day in the week before, to an average of nine per day in the past week.The number of unlinked cases in the community has also increased, from an average of three cases per day in the week before, to an average of five per day in the past week.""We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme,"" MOH said.IMPORTED CASEThe health ministry reported a new imported case involving a permanent resident, who is a family member of a previous case.The 11-year-old had returned from India on Jun 21, and was placed on a stay-home notice upon his arrival in Singapore.He was taken to an isolation facility to start his 14-day notice. The boy was asymptomatic, and was tested while serving the stay-home notice.A total of 175 cases reported on Saturday were work permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories, the ministry added. No new clusters were identified.348 MORE PATIENTS DISCHARGEDMOH reported that 348 more COVID-19 patients have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 40,117 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.There are currently 204 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and two are in a critical condition in the intensive care unit. A total of 4,317 cases are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are people who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. Twenty-six people have died from complications due to COVID-19 infection.TESTING AT TAMPINES BLOCKMOH said on Thursday that it placed 58 households at Block 111 Tampines Street 11 under active phone surveillance and that these residents and their visitors would be tested for COVID-19.""This is a precautionary measure after MOH had detected nine confirmed cases from two households residing at the block.""In total, 116 residents and visitors have been tested, and all the results have come back
negative for COVID-19. MOH will continue to closely monitor the situation,"" the ministry said. On Friday, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) announced hotels in Singapore may apply to reopen for staycation bookings.

Telangana and Karnataka, two of the fastest growing states right now, reported 1,213 and 1,502 cases respectively, while 845 new cases were found in Andhra Pradesh.Odisha also happened to record its highest single-day number of Thursday, reporting as many as 561 new cases. The state, after growing rapidly in May, had slowed down a bit in the last few weeks. Thursday’s jump was more than double of what it was usually reporting in the last ten days. The state now has 8,106 confirmed infections.Remarkably, as many as 8,018 patients were declared discharged in Maharashtra on Thursday, almost four times the usual figure these days. This is the second time that Maharashtra has reported more than 8,000 recoveries in a single day. Before this, on May 29, the state had declared 8,381 people as discharged. That has been the only occasion so far when the number of recoveries across the country exceeded the number of new cases detected.But just like the previous time, Thursday’s figure too is a result of adding up of unreported recoveries in the state from past several days. As a result of this jump, the number of recoveries on Thursday came quite close to the number of new infections detected. There were 20,032 recoveries reported from across the country, while 20,903 new cases were detected. This daily recovery against daily detection of new cases is one of the key indicators to watch out for. If the number of people recovering every day exceeds those falling sick, and the trend holds for at least two weeks, it could be a signal of the disease arriving near its peak. As of now, that stage still seems a little far off.But the recoveries are likely to go up significantly in the coming days because of a change in guidelines for patients with mild symptoms who have been placed under home quarantine. On Thursday, the Health Ministry said such patients can now be declared as discharged after ten days from the onset of symptoms, if they don’t have fever for three days. Earlier, they used to be discharged after at least 17 days. This will apply to asymptomatic cases as well. If they remain asymptomatic throughout, they can be considered discharged ten days after detection. The patients under home isolation would no longer required to be tested before being declared as discharged.📣 Express Explained is now on Telegram.

The state has so far tested 10.2 lakh samples. Tamil Nadu, the only other state with a million-plus tests, has tested 12.35 lakh samples. These two states also happen to host the largest number of laboratories in the country, both in the government and private sector.

He is not looking for a cure on its own. He is more focused on finding treatments with drugs used for other viruses such as HIV and SARS.But will there ever be a cure for COVID-19?

covid19,MMR vaccine could prevent worst symptoms of COVID-19,Medical News Today,https://www.google.com/url?rct=j&sa=t&url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/mmr-vaccine-could-prevent-worst-symptoms-of-covid-19&ct=ga&cd=CAAYCTIdZmQyNzJjNDk4NjUwYWNmYzpjb20uc2c6ZW46U0c&usg=AFQjCNGranyXzZNEONSGaPfcgK6aY3W1dg,"MedicalNewsToday.com uses cookies to improve your site experience and to show you personalized advertising. To learn more, please read our Privacy Policy.The MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine could help to prevent inflammation in COVID-19, which is associated with the most severe symptoms of the disease.All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our coronavirus hub and follow our live updates page for the most recent information on the COVID-19 outbreak.There is growing evidence to suggest that using existing vaccines could be beneficial against COVID-19 — even though they are not specific to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.Several clinical trials are taking place around the world to test whether using the BCG (Bacillus Calmette–Guérin) vaccine, which protects against tuberculosis (TB), could be effective in COVID-19.Scientists think that the vaccine could boost a person’s immune response, reduce their levels of SARS-CoV-2, and lessen the symptoms associated with COVID-19.Stay informed with live updates on the current COVID-19 outbreak and visit our coronavirus hub for more advice on prevention and treatment.A new report published in the American Society for Microbiology’s journal mBio suggests that the MMR vaccine, which is routinely administered in childhood, could serve a similar purpose.The researchers behind the article suggest that the vaccine could dampen the severe inflammation associated with COVID-19 and mortality, and propose a clinical trial for healthcare workers.The type of vaccines that have an effect against unrelated infectious are called live attenuated vaccines. This means they contain real viruses or bacteria that scientists have weakened in a laboratory.Studies show that these vaccines protect against other infections by ‘training’ the immune system in a non-specific way. This type of non-specific immune response is the first line of defense against infection and is called the innate immune response.“Live attenuated vaccines seemingly have some nonspecific benefits as well as immunity to the target pathogen,” explains co-author of the new paper Dr. Paul Fidel, Jr., Associate Dean for Research at Louisiana State University Health School of Dentistry in New Orleans.Dr. Fidel, together with Dr. Mairi Noverr, Professor of Microbiology & Immunology at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, suggest that the protection afforded by these vaccines is due to myeloid-derived suppressor cells, or MDSCs, a type of immune cell that comes from bone marrow.Scientists have shown that these cells can reduce inflammation and mortality in mouse models of infection. In their own research, Drs. Fidel and Noverr have shown that vaccination with a live-attenuated fungus may protect against sepsis thanks to MDSCs.Drs. Fidel and Noverr say an MMR vaccine could induce MDSCs in people with COVID-19, which could help them to fight the lung inflammation and sepsis associated with the most severe forms of the disease.As evidence for this, they cite the recent case where 955 sailors on the U.S.S. Roosevelt tested positive for COVID-19 but only experienced mild symptoms.The researchers suggest that this may be because all U.S. Navy recruits receive the MMR vaccination. However, it is likely that the age and fitness of the sailors also played a part in their recovery.Other evidence in support of a connection between the MMR vaccine and COVID-19 recovery comes from epidemiological data. People who live in areas that routinely receive the MMR vaccine have lower COVID-19 death rates.COVID-19 is also less likely to affect children, which may also have links to vaccination. While age is a known risk factor for COVID-19 severity, the fact that many children have had more recent exposure to live attenuated vaccines could also play a role in their protection, the article suggests.Adults who received the MMR vaccine as a child will likely still have antibodies against the measles, mumps and rubella viruses, but are unlikely to still have MDSCs, says Dr. Fidel. This means they would require a ‘booster’ vaccination to obtain the potential benefits against COVID-19.“While the MDSCs are long-lived, they are not life-long cells. So, a booster MMR would enhance the antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella and reinitiate the MDSCs. We would hope that the MDSCs induced by the MMR would have a fairly good life-span to get through the critical time of the pandemic.”The researchers have proposed a clinical trial of the MMR vaccine in high-risk healthcare workers and first responders in New Orleans. They have also been awarded a grant to compare the MMR and BCG vaccines in a primate model of COVID-19.“While we are conducting the clinical trials, I don’t think it’s going to hurt anybody to have an MMR vaccine that would protect against the measles, mumps, and rubella with this potential added benefit of helping against COVID-19.”– Dr. Paul FidelIf their hypothesis is correct, the authors say use of the MMR vaccine could present a ‘low-risk-high-reward’ measure to save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic.No current medicine can prevent or cure COVID-19.

covid19,RE:Are HIV patients high risk for COVID19? Or do antiretrovirals have a protective effect?,Source: askscienceForum: AskScience Forum,https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/hl782i/are_hiv_patients_high_risk_for_covid19_or_do/fwxfw4y/,"HIV antiretrovirals only destroy retroviruses. COVID19 is a coronavirus therefore antiretroviral medications do NOT have a protective effect on COVID19.HIV patients do not have an increased risk for COVID19 if they are currently undetectable and have an acceptable/normal amount of CD4 cells.Further to this; though some anti-HIV medications are being studied to treat or prevent COVID-19, there is no evidence yet that they work.To date lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) and tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada), were thought may be effective but updates from trials have not shown effectiveness.To expand upon, someone who is undetectable is someone under treatment. They take their meds on time and regularly, and go get tested two-to-four times a year. Someone who is undetectable is also uninfectious, which is why civilized nations subsidize or cover HIV treatment.Someone who is not being treated, whose virus is resistant to current treatment, or who is unable to maintain the drug regimen, will be susceptible to their CD4 count falling, which means their immune system becomes more vulnerable. Such a person will be more vulnerable to COVID and other infections and will be infectious; the higher your virus level, the more infectious you are.MembersOnline"

covid19,Scott Adams: Is every risk factor for #COVID19 a Vitamin D deficiency in disguise?,Source: Latest ArticlesForum: Bloggers & Personal,http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-bloggers/3845264/posts,"Skip to comments.Posted on 5/16/2020, 12:11:54 AM by grundleScott Adams: just brought up this really great point at Twitter. This is what he said:Is every risk factor for #COVID19 a Vitamin D deficiency in disguise? Google it: old, overweight, black, diabetic, smog dwellers, nursing homes, prisons, shaded NYC streets, Chinese urban dwellers, covered body parts (Iran). All would have vitamin D issues.Maybe we only think the heat and sunlight and humidity are what makes most viruses fade in summer. I believe science is not entirely sure why summer helps. All four variables seem promising, including Vitamin D. But the latter explains more observations.Does the Vitamin D correlation work In reverse too? Who is doing unexpectedly well at keeping COVID19 at bay? Texas, Florida, other outdoorsy states. How about kids. Do your kids wear sunscreen every time they go in the backyard or street? Probably not.Prisons are showing high infection rates but low deaths. Just learned that prison meals are engineered with vitamin D supplements. Makes sense.I think each and every one of those points is excellent.Is every risk factor for #COVID19 a Vitamin D deficiency in disguise?

Makes sense.— Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) May 8, 2020Obesity is not caused lack of by Vit D.There may be some truth there. I dunno. I’m inclined to believe it.Almost every day since early March (I miss days though) I have been taking Vitamin D and Zinc. Once or twice a week I take Vitamin C too.Far as I know I have not been exposed to the virus though, and I’m not trying to find out if these vitamins will help to be honest.You might find this interesting:https://www.newsweek.com/vitamin-d-supplement-linked-weight-loss-overweight-and-obese-children-1140838Can’t argue with that. Another low-cost/no-cost preventative.What does Vitamin D do for the body that helps it to resist/fend off the rona?cows milk has Vitamin D added due to so many getting rickets in the bad old days. But fewer people are drinking milk today.But Vit D gets deposited in fat, so obese people need higher doses.
He’s saying they’re more likely to be deficient.I don’t know the validity of Vitamin D deficiency being a risk factor of Covid-19, but I have been trying to boost my immune system by taking vitamins, consuming foods high in Vitamin D, etc......But obese are not outside jogging, are they ?No but heavy people have a higher propensity to be the indoor types.Helps activate the immune system, such as T-cells.Perhaps not directly; but it probably does so indirectly, particularly in terms of fatigue, muscle weakness, etc:https://www.medicinenet.com/vitamin_d_deficiency/article.htmhttps://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/15050-vitamin-d—vitamin-d-deficiencyInteresting theory.I think he point is that the obese are often Vitamin D deficient, not that Vitamin D deficiency causes Obesity.Correlation is not causation. I could be that the Vitamin D deficiency and the Obesity may be caused by the same factors.But, the premise here is that the Vitamin D deficiency causes susceptibility to the disease, and the correlation to Obesity is explained by the correlation of Obesity and Vitamin D deficiency, and that it is actually the Vitamin D deficiency that is causing the problem.I posted this article on COVID and Vitamin D deficiency a while back:https://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/3842447/postsI don’t think he’s saying that. Vitamin D is manufactured in the body partly by skin exposure to direct sunlight. He’s saying a lot of obese people don’t show a lot of skin even in summer.Vitamin D is made from sub cutaneous 7-Dehydrocholesterol a cholesterol metabolite from the cholesterol humans make naturally internally. Humans (all skin pigmented types) exposed to sunlight biochemically convert this cholesterol metabolite into Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol).https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-DehydrocholesterolThe symptoms of severe prolonged sunlight (sunburn) have excessive Vitamin D production (overdose) in the description— severe headaches from the excess D (which is a fat soluble Vitamin and takes a long time to be cleared from the body— through the liver and gall bladder).I’ve read the data and the studies. I’m convinced. However, I’m not willing to get the virus to prove a point. But I will live my life as I see fit.

Two cousins came from out of town (we don’t know why they came, they weren’t immediate family) and we found out today she tested positive for covid. It’s been 7 days and my family of three in my household hasn’t shown symptoms but will quarantine the last week to prevent it for others.Has anyone came in contact with a covid 19 person and ended up not having it? 😭Yep. My friend’s maid (so they see her everyday all day) tested positive a couple of weeks ago (she developed a cough and high temperature) and my friend and her husband and two young children have been self isolating since (they have 2 days left) But none of them have developed symptoms.The maid was ill for two days and that was it , and as she’s not had symptoms for over a week, she’s allowed to carry on life as normal but my friend and her family still have to isolate for 2 more days until their two weeks is up...Is a strange rule!I was quoting the OP - I don’t know if they wore masks, I was guessing no.Your family member is diagnosed with cancer and you decide to have a large gathering during a pandemic? I'm sorry you're freaking out, but this was totally predictable.oh my gosh!! I’m so sorry! I’m here if you need 💚💚Were people social distancing, outside. wearing masks and not sharing food? I think a lot depends on how safe people were being.yes to allYou said to someone else that you hugged and talked closely for an hour... I would be shocked if you don’t have it. Hopefully your uncle doesn’t get it.I don't think you know what social distancing means.I will never understand people having gatherings right now especially when a family member was diagnosed with a disease where they need to protect their immune system.Hope the surgeries go well and he makes a quick and full recovery. ❤️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️ew your name says it all lol bye KarenOk so last Sunday we had 9 ppl over. Few days later my MIL (she was over) said she’s had headaches. She got tested, came back positive. So we kinda freaked out, got tested, were waiting. My FIL tested negative. Other than my MIL’s headaches, nobody has had symptoms...so I dunno 🤷🏽‍♀️You didn't take precautions though. You hugged her and sat less than 6 feet away. Those aren't precautions.my brother in laws mom took care of an elderly lady that had it and she didnt get itJust another example of why America can’t get COVID19 under control. Thanks OP for contributing to the problem. While I’m sorry about your uncle, a zoom gathering, or drive by, or one at a time with lots of cleaning in between would have been a much better option.I agree. A large gathering during a pandemic is stupidWell having a large family gathering wasn’t the best idea. There have been stories all over the news of large parties getting infected from one person. Maybe you’ll get lucky and not get any symptoms. Next time be smarter.I had covid I’m March and neither my son or my boyfriend who both live with me have been ill, they may have just been symptomless though.I also can’t understand why anyone would risk going to a gathering right now.

Which is in Collier county and is a growing hotspot for the Coronavirus. And those Immokolee residents belong to the group of people most harshly affected. Poor, Hispanic or black, lots of comorbidities. Capacity is something that should worry you more if you are a Naples resident.I work in two of Naples ICUs, part time at one and full time at the other. The question of capacity is complicated by the seasonal nature of the community. Physicians Regional hires extra seasonal staff during the ‘season’ and now most of those employees have left or the contracts have run out. NCH has ‘contract’ employees that they also employ to deal with extra patients during the busy season, but NCH can and will hire more contract workers for 4 to 13 week contracts depending on the need. Right now, not many of those mostly season nurses are left.Physicians also has rooms than can be used at double capacity during the season, except for ICU beds. Staffing those beds needs extra season staff. The only ‘overflow’ ICU beds that Physicians has is when they use one half of the PACU for ICU patients. It that is a mostly a temporary fix.The ICU at the North NCH hospital has 16 beds. The problem is that the current off season staffing grid only calls for 4 nurses, with a charge nurse that also always takes a full patient team.At Physicians on Pine Ridge there are 12 ICU beds with an attached step down unit that has 7 beds. The charge nurse at Physicians is also the charge nurse of the stepdown unit and the other neuro unit on the second floor, called 2 East.MembersOnline"

So far I've reduced. to 50mg per day and my BP has not increased dramatically. Still always below 120 Sys and usually about 70 Dia. He has advised I can stop it all together myself and I should just keep checking BP. He does not believe I should have been put on it in the first place, neither did the specialist I saw.I'm exercising daily (60mins bike) and losing approx 1.5Kg per week, although that trend is slowing as I lose more weight.I also have a history of allergic reactions, severe to bee sting when I was a child, also have mild allergies to grass/hayfever etc.I also had mild Vit D deficiency, I've been taking 3000IU Vit D for the last approx 2 months to try and counter that.Iam an Ex smoker too, smoked from approx 18-25.

The thing that confuses me though is given the huge spread of COVID19 in the USA, and it's very high percentage of people with obesity, shouldn't there be a much higher percentage of deaths?
